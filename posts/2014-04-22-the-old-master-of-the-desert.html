<p><em>The following note, which the author discovered as an inexplicable addition by an unknown scribe in an old printed book of the works of Cornelius Nepos, is written in a combination of Greek and Latin, which is faithfully translated alike into English without any embellishing or editing; we leave the authenticity of these documents to be judged by the reader.</em></p>
<p>Philippus, to his brother Xanthus, sends greetings.</p>
<p>If you should have wondered, as I no doubt reckon that you will do, dear brother, for what reason I have composed to you a letter with the bulk of its body being in the tongue of the Latins, that most foul and vulgar and undignified language, which we have spent many a night mocking in such colourful terms back in our schooling days, when—surely you remember—our haughty Latin instructor would finally end his droning pseudo-Hellenic grammatical speeches and retire to his chamber, and the same language for which I recall you to have such a marked disgust that you chose to forsake the scribal profession that has for so long been a tradition of our family, lest you should be forced to compose in Latin by the Roman officials, I will first explain the source of this text, which I shall include in this letter and which is not of my own authorship, but which have rather arisen in a most curious and unusual circumstance that I can only believe to be the doing of the gods and goddesses. Indeed, although I find the text, even judged by the inferior standards of Latin writing, to be a most unseemly and even abominable specimen in terms of style and cohesion, its content is sufficiently admirable that it inspired a certain astonishment—nay, religious awe in me, a text which I can only describe analogically to be the product that should be expected from a peasant of no formal education at all, and who might even have a marked tendency to stammering, if he should be simultaneously enlightened by the combined efforts of Dionysus and of golden-voiced Calliope. But analogy can only stimulate a vague impression; I should now tell you a little of the circumstances, a most remarkable one as I have already said, under which I have acquired the text that I shall transmit to you.</p>
<p>For you, my well-informed brother, have no doubt heard the news that my employer and master, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, has succeeded in a secret diplomatic mission to the most treacherous kingdom of Parthia to negotiate the safe return of legion standards and soldiers that were captured, thirty years ago, during the campaign of hapless Crassus against that country. Of the day when the Parthians have handed the golden eagles and prisoners back to us I shall not say much; I am confident that bards will sing of it and of the glory that Lord Augustus has obtained for Rome for many thousand years to come, to which my poor prose accustomed to camp reports and the like cannot possibly add anything. I mention this event, however, because the subject and relater of this story, a certain Gaius Carfulenus, was one of the veterans returned to us on that fateful day. Now those veterans, you must know, although this is unlikely to be reported in the official accounts, are for the most part so thoroughly Parthianised that it took Agrippa a great amount of bribery to persuade them to leave their Parthian wives and mongrel children behind and to return to Rome as proof of his great success. Though Carfulenus was different in that he never married nor settled down in Parthian lands, his Latin has become rather lamentably (and I do not easily lament misuses of the Latin language) deficient, and in addition to this his mind so enfeebled and disturbed and under what is either a divine or a most evil influence, that it was no easy feat to make sense of half the things he said. Agrippa left to tend to his other businesses almost as soon as this man started speaking and instructed me to write down the story that this agitated veteran anxiously desired to tell us; this thing I did, in as coherent a way as I can in view of his very poor Latin grammar, and presented to Agrippa. By that time, however, he had already lost interest in the whole affair, so he merely laughed it off as the ramblings of a madman. For the locations and personages which Carfulenus, the veteran, mentioned in his story are, he assured me, figments of the imagination, and he knew Parthian customs sufficiently to be able to assert with absolute certainty that none of the events Carfulenus claimed to have experienced were real. Before I took my leave, however, he instructed me to burn this story and to tell no one about it, since he found the religious and philosophical sentiments which it may be construed to express so utterly against that of Lord Augustus that to let word come out that a Crassian veteran had such a story to tell would undermine and spoil the religious message that Lord Augustus intended to convey with this deed. But just before I set out to fulfil Agrippa’s command, I was, so to say, almost grasped back from the fireplace by a most powerful urge to save this story for posterity, which I took to be a message from Dionysus or Lyssa or whatever deity or spirit that first touched the veteran to tell his story. I burned a used piece of paper and secretly took my transcript of his story back to my quarters, where I then composed the letter that you are presently reading and hurried it to you by some courier I bribed, along with the transcript.</p>
<p>It is my hope, brother, that you shall conceal this letter for now, lest I be punished for disobedience; hopefully, a future generation, which is not so tangled in the political struggle between Rome and Parthia, will one day come by this story and make something out of it, which Agrippa and, I fear, the rest of the Romans, are prejudiced to overlook. Here, then, I shall set forth the veteran’s story:</p>
<hr />
<p>Under the black moon and the still blacker stars, as is the colour to which the moon and the stars are wont in this quarter of the world, we wandered, hundreds of us, through hostile territories hitherto undiscovered by our countrymen. Among us were men of all races who had incurred the wrath of Parthia by war or by criminal deeds: Greeks, Romans, Parthians, Jews, Bactrians, Armenians, Scythians, Indians and even a few Chinese captured in skirmishes, all forced to march in the most unforgiving night in a desert that stretch many thousand miles from end to end, a desert of many names and of no name, about which many bards have sung and no bard has sung.</p>
<p>I cannot now remember how we arrived there from dreadful Carrhae, where General Crassus met his bloody end, nor even the location of that most inhospitable desert into which the Parthians, soon after we were captured, hand-picked some thirty of us to be driven. I was one of that most unfortunate group of men, out of which I alone returned from the desert with my life; the captors picked us, I was told by a more sympathetic Parthian corporal who knew some rudiments of Latin, who was charged with conveying orders to us captives, to traverse the desert along with condemned men of other races, following an ancient tradition, for the desert was so known for its hostility to any life that it was reviled by the Parthians far more than Great Arabia, even more so than we reviled the lands south of Numidia. For this reason only those marked for certain death were sent into this desert, and no cartographer ever incorporated this area into his map.</p>
<p>Among us to be sent into the desert was to be found no warden or overseer; this was deemed unnecessary, and we soon realised the reason after the Parthian army forced us, under pain of death, to go into the desert. For, just as we walked far enough that the Parthians had disappeared under the horizon, we decided, under the advice of a few particularly loud Greeks who deemed themselves our leaders, to turn back and sneak out of the vast and ruthless desert in some other location so as to avoid our captors. This clever scheme turned out, however, to be fruitless: we wandered the desert in the precise direction that we were sure we entered from, but hours passed and we were still in the middle of a sea of sand, with no exit in sight. This greatly confused the Greeks, for we have meticulously followed our own footsteps backwards and should have, by then, returned to the exact spot where the Parthians released us. The Parthian prisoners, however, who were familiar with the practice of banishing men into this desert and who had been warning us about the inutility of the Greeks’ plan from the beginning, now spoke with the mixed emotion of both being vindicated in their conviction and the confirmation that they were doomed to death with no way out. They said that the desert was enchanted with an ancient and evil magic so as to prevent us from escaping, and that they would have no more to do with the rest of us, who were unacquainted with Parthian teachings on magic, and would resign themselves to a peaceful death.</p>
<p>So we left behind all the Parthians, who sat down upon the sand and refused ever to stand up again, except for a few men who, perhaps out of a stubborn refusal to believe in the kind of magic that their elders preached and the extremely remote hope that we can find a way out of the desert after all, decided to remain with the rest of us and keep on walking. The Greeks prayed to their god Hermes, whom I gather is much like our Mercury, to dispel whatever foul magic the Parthians summoned upon themselves; but it was evident that they did not really believe in Parthian magic yet and were still clinging to the hope that our predicament had merely been due to an error made when we were tracing our steps back. But soon night fell on the desert, and it became evident that the desert really harboured some supernatural occurrences. What immediately struck us was the moon, and the stars, and the sky that glowed with a nearly purple hue. This scared even the most pious of the Jews; for I should have mentioned that they had hitherto remained steadfast on their belief that their singular god would surely deliver them, all good and loyal Jews, from this nightmarish place, just as he had delivered them numerous times from evil crimes that had been done unto their people. Yet seeing the supernatural night sky made them suspect that their god, whom they still believed to have been responsible for making this desert, had also abandoned them and would not render aid upon them.</p>
<p>At this time another terrible thing had befallen us that made us thoroughly terrified: a sandstorm, of a size that no one had ever seen in the heart of the African desert, formed on the horizon, barely visible at first but soon growing into a roaring, menacing whirlwind, which came almost straight towards us. At first we tried to flee, but this was perfectly useless; for the storm was of such a size that, by the time it arrived, all of us were still caught by its raging winds. The wind was of such a speed that many of us were picked up by the wind and violently tossed about, and when it finally left us after what seemed like an eternity some of us simply disappeared, as if devoured by the storm. The remainder, of which I was thankfully a part of, all suffered various degrees of injury, which slowed us down considerably.</p>
<p>The demoralising effect the sandstorm had on us was soon apparent, for more and more men among us felt that merely attempting to walk out of the desert was perfectly useless, and that kneeling down and praying to their respective gods was the only way to be extricated from here. Some of us Romans, too, decided to erect a makeshift shrine to Mercury and to Apollo (for it was hoped that he could make the sun come out again and guide us), and I would almost have joined them myself, if it weren’t for the bickering that immediately started between adherents of different religions. The Jews accused us and the Greeks of idolatry, which they held to have angered their god and made him turn his back upon all of us; the Greeks, in return, said that the singular devotion of the Jews to their capricious god excluded us from receiving the aid of other, perhaps more benevolent gods. Soon men of the other races, the ones that remained with us, joined the argument with praises of their own gods and the various reasons why they were superior to all others. It was apparent after a while that the bickering was not so much to demonstrate any actual theological superiority as much as it was another form of prayer: by disparaging with increasing vehemence each other’s gods, each had hoped that their own gods would be increasingly pleased, perhaps eventually to the point that they would finally relent and grant deliverance unto their chosen people. From all this I recoiled by nature; I did not stay away from them because I was impious or held some grudge against our own Roman gods, but rather because I saw the whole farce as nonsensical: whatever gods there may exist would surely have been most annoyed and repulsed by this pathetic display of discord and uselessness. I exhorted my fellow Romans to exercise our Roman pragmatism and gravity and to ignore the lesser peoples’ quarrelling; just as they had almost been swayed by my simple appeals, however, a certain Publius Aemilius Lepidus, a man of the highest birth, who had doubtlessly received an excellent Greek education and who had previously been one of our officers, angrily accused me of impiety; his heated condemnation, which was so full of Graecisms and Hellenic figures that neither I nor the other men understood it completely, nevertheless won them over by virtue of its authority and vehemence, and so I was ostracised from them with a stern warning not to come back and to displease the gods in their company.</p>
<p>Thus I was forced to leave the main body of the men, although it did not bother me too much, for I was no longer assaulted by a crescendo of insults that the others hurled on each other on behalf of their respective religion. Not long after I left the others, however, I heard behind myself somebody crying for my attention in the Parthian tongue, and I turned around and saw an elderly Parthian man supporting by the arm a man whom I could only guess to be Chinese, with his legs broken—doubtlessly by the sandstorm—but whose lame steps nevertheless betrayed a sense of urgency, as if he had to keep moving forward no matter what. Both of them were older than I was at the time, and both seemed evidently to be the scholarly type of men, unsuited to long voyages across the desert, so I guessed that they sought my help in carrying what little baggages they had on them. This I did not mind, for although I could not converse in Parthian nor (evidently) in Chinese, the mere presence of companions had a pleasing effect on one’s mind, and the trek seemed not nearly so arduous. I not only offered to carry both their burdens, but also volunteered to support the injured Chinese man myself, which evidently delighted them and put myself into good enough graces that the Parthian soon began to attempt to strike up a conversation with me in Latin. I was a bit taken aback, but the Parthian’s Latin, though by no means fluent, was good enough to be comprehensible. So in this way we talked as we ventured forward. He had been, the Parthian explained, a camp scribe in the service of some ambitious general of theirs, whose campaigns had taken himself and my new friend from engaging with the Romans in Syria to repelling Chinese incursions in the far northern boundary of Bactria, over which the three nations, China, Parthia and Bactria, fought constantly. In this way he learned the rudiments of both Latin and Chinese. Of the reason why he was condemned into the desert he did not say much, and I did not press him to reveal, for it must be painful to be condemned by one’s compatriots to a fate which he had been taught to be the very worst one could suffer since his childhood. The Chinese man with him, he said, was the last one among us surviving of that race; the rest had all perished in the sandstorm. For this reason the other peoples wished to offer him as sacrifice to their respective gods, and this Chinese man, being a camp scribe like himself and furthermore disabled by the storm, was in no position to defend himself. Seeing his plight, the Parthian, who had been deputised by the others, because of his knowledge of the Chinese tongue, to relay commands and decisions to the fellows of that nation, took pity on him and helped him escape while the rest were too preoccupied in their heated argument over which gods or goddesses were to have the honour of receiving this man as votive offering.</p>
<p>Naturally, I then asked them about what plan they may have for bringing ourselves out of the desert. The Parthian said that he knew none, but that the Chinese man insisted on going forward, no matter the direction. This fascinated me enough that I asked him if he could enquire of the Chinese the reason for his conviction. The Parthian said that he was happy to oblige, and then he spoke again, but not in the Latin tongue any more, but rather in a most alien and barbarous sounding language that made me recoil in its sheer unfamiliarity to me, but which I judged to be the tongue of the Chinese, since at once the Chinese man leaning on my shoulder and walking forward with great difficulty turned his head and listened intently. By the time the Parthian finished speaking and the Chinese man started to answer him, I realised that not even the alienness of the Parthian’s mimicry of the Chinese tongue, which was surely delivered in what a native speaker of that tongue would perceive as a very heavy Parthian accent just as I perceived his Latin to possess, captured sufficiently how exotic and how utterly dissimilar to our own language the speech of the Chinese people was, for the response came in a sound that I did not know human beings were capable of producing, and which, had the dignified man speaking it not been in my sight, I would have considered to be animalistic growls, such was the barbarity of the language.</p>
<p>The Parthian, however, seemed to comprehend well enough this language, and he proceeded to interpret the speech to me in Latin. All learned Chinese, he said, knew the story of an ancient and exceedingly wise man, who had been universally revered as a great teacher in his own lifetime hundred of years ago but whose teaching had become, in our days, occult knowledge known only to men of good education. Though the name of this once-venerated man was not forgotten, he was known to most merely as the “Old Master”, a name which was reserved by the Chinese for him alone. In his old age, this man abandoned his homeland and journeyed on an ox’s back to the northwestern wastelands, after which he was believed to have died near the border. But some believed that the Old Master did not really die, but rather travelled even further into the desert which no man dared entering, and it was said that through his wisdom he came to magically transform this desert into a nearly mythical place where he would dwell for all eternity. It was said that by walking further and further inside one may eventually encounter the Old Master, now immortal, in his abode at the very heart of the desert, whence one may acquire the ultimate wisdom that the Old Master had gained over the years. Such rumours, however, did not excite a flurry of pilgrimages into the desert, he said, as one would have expected. For the condition of the desert into which the Old Master was rumoured to have disappeared—doubtlessly, he said, the same one we now found ourselves in—was sufficiently treacherous so as to deter all attempts at an expedition, and in addition to this the teachings of the Old Master soon gave way in popularity to that of a contemporary of his, whose name he mentioned but I could not presently recall and who argued that the supreme virtue is, much like we Romans believed, to devote oneself to public service and politics and other worldly matters. For the liberal society of the Old Master’s days had since been usurped by kings who zealously promoted this rival school of thought and decreed that the works of all other ancient sages should henceforth be banned. In no more than a few generations even the desire to meet the immortalised Old Master had waned, and rumours of his apotheosis dissipated into but an old legend circulating among men of education.</p>
<p>To all this I reacted with incredulity, for I reckoned this Old Master of their people to be, based on his description, a philosopher not unlike the sort they produce in Athens and Asia. Those men of idleness are wont to spread rumours of the apotheosis of one of their own, so as to excite general interest and veneration for their rather despicable profession. Surely it must be the doing of a deity, I remarked dispassionately, or some foul magic to entrap hundreds of living soul in a place like this, and not merely the philosophy of learned old men. But this angered the Chinese man, who said defensively that the Old Master’s teachings are not merely philosophy, but the very truth of reality and of existence. Unwilling to discuss the matter further—for I am but a military man whose sole education consisted of two philosophical lessons General Crassus thought fit to have a Greek doctor give us, and had soon thenceforth ceased—I muttered some generic apology which seemed to suffice in defusing the tense atmosphere (for the Chinese man owed after all to my aid in order that he may walk). But thereafter we walked mostly in silence, and I could not help but think that I may have been judged unworthy of any further mysteries that the Chinese man harboured.</p>
<p>About this time we were hit again by a sandstorm, this one even more powerful and terrifying. The Parthian lost all hope as soon as he saw the storm forming on the horizon and fell prostrate muttering some ancient charms against natural disasters, while the Chinese man freed himself from my help and stumbled forward a few steps, before losing his balance from his injured leg and falling to the ground. On the surface I kept my composure; but inside I was as afraid as the two of them were, as all men would have been in such a situation. Somehow I had a very firm conviction right there that this would be my end, that I would not survive this sandstorm the same way I had survived the previous one; for this fate I was naturally frightened, but I could not help but feel in some ways relieved. For I knew at least that all would be over, that I would be deposited safely in the underworld, in the hands of the Di Manes; and I reckoned that however unfamiliar and hostile the underworld might be, surely it would not exceed this most unnatural desert in brutality. This thought gave me comfort, and I briefly forgot the perilous situation that we were in and tried to picture in my mind what the underworld might look like. It was said to be in a state of perpetual night, but there would be no sand—for sands were alien to our Latin ancestors—and that already made it look a thousand times more attractive to me than this desert. Some said that there would be rivers, fields, souls of the departed wandering about. Perhaps my comrades fallen in the disaster at Carrhae still awaited me, still remained to receive me to them? Then I thought that I was ready. Let me die and be reunited with the legion. This was to be my last thought, not undignified as far as last thoughts are concerned, I think.</p>
<p>Then the sandstorm hit us, and I thought that all was over. The Parthian was the first to be tossed into the sky, and he struggled and yelled almost at the top of his lungs the last words of the magical incantation he was chanting. But the sandstorm was in no way deterred, and proceeded to pick up the Chinese man, who was clearly conscious but made no attempt to struggle, merely allowed himself to be hurled wherever the wind willed. I was the last to be affected by the wind, and I resolved to emulate the Chinese man so as to preserve my dignity as I prepared to embrace death. I relaxed and purged all thought from myself and felt acutely the grains of sand violently battering against my inadequately clothed torso (for our armour were confiscated by the Parthians and we were left with but tunics to wear). The storm lasted for what seemed an eternity. At first I could see my two compatriots about, but soon they were hurled beyond my sand-obstructed sight, and I closed my eyes to acquaint myself with the sensations of flying involuntarily in a flurry of sands. Peacefully, I gave in to the wind.</p>
<p>But then the storm ended, as suddenly as it had begun. I lost all memories of the interceding moments, and all that I could remember was lying prostrate on the sandy ground, feeling nothing but the caress of the sand on my face and the burning heat of the sun on my back. With great difficulty I pulled myself together and stood up; the night was gone; the sun shined from its celestial seat just as it had always done. Yet a most curious sight, one that made me forgot even to celebrate my miraculous survival, was a prodigious aedifice standing alone in the ocean of sands, constructed doubtlessly by the effort of many thousand labourers in an architectural style unknown to me, which seemed to be beyond the imaginations of even the most unorthodox Greek architect; I reckoned it briefly to be Chinese architecture, but the bewilderment of my Chinese companion, who had also survived and, like me, found his eyes transfixed upon the lone structure, spelled beyond any doubt that he had not seen anything quite like what we beheld then. It was at that time when I realised that the Parthian was gone, snatched away by the storm. But this was no time for lamenting him; both my lone surviving friend and I, though we now lost the only man who could facilitate our communication, looked at each other with the unspoken agreement that we ought to reach, as quickly as possible, this supernaturally constructed structure before us, which doubtlessly held the answer that we were meant to discover, the exit from this dreadful desert which we all sought desperately. But above all, I think, it was out of curiosity for the building itself that we were compelled to approach it, for the aedifice seemed to us to have been built for an unfathomable purpose: for as a temple it was too large and too plain, and as a citadel it was too indefensible, not to mention one would scarcely expect an armed incursion into the heart of the desert.</p>
<p>With these questions we walked, the Chinese man with my help again, forgetting momentarily our hunger and thirst and weariness, up to the entrance of the unknown structure. Silently and without any operator in sight the gates opened, revealing to us a barely-lit interior of inestimable size, but which was wholly empty save for the columns which seemed not so much erected to hold up the roof as to present the true extent of the interior space, for we counted at least fifty pillars panning away from us before receding entirely into the darkest recesses of the great hall. We were overcome with awe and forgot our good manners and walked straight inside without waiting for an usher. In the very farthest distance—as far as our eyes could see—we barely made out the figure of a very old man, and as we approached him without invitation the ancientness of this man dawned upon me; for his face was so distorted by numerous layers of wrinkling that I could barely have made out his visage, and in addition to this his beard, which was as white as the snow in Gaul, reached such an incredible length that he let it flow all the way to the ground, where it layered upon itself and formed a great mass that was unbelievable to behold. His face wore an utterly inscrutable emotion, as if not a single occurrence in the world would surprise him in the least bit. In this way we stared rudely at him as if he was a sculpture of some sort, though I must concede that even the best of our sculptors could not have imagined a man of such a sacred visage. It was not until after a while that I felt compelled to greet this very old man in the most dignified manner I had ever learned, with greater veneration than I would have afforded Jupiter the Steadfast, before silently cursing myself of my stupidity, for surely this man, having perhaps never known a thing about we Romans in his lifetime, knew nothing about Latin and would not understand at all my greeting. He smiled, however, and as soon as he opened his mouth I was nearly physically taken aback; for it was unmistakably the Latin tongue, our native Roman tongue, with which he spoke to me, and not with an accent as even the most Romanised provincial would never succeed in getting rid of theirs, but rather in a voice as pure and as eloquent as our great orator Cicero, one of whose speeches to the public I once attended before being sent off to the East. In fact, after he had spoken a few sentences I realised that his speech was not only in perfect, unblemished Latin, but also in a poetic meter that he produced with effortless familiarity, which reminded me that our greatest poet Ennius once remarked that poetry was the speech of the gods. In fact, being addressed to in such dignified speech by a man of unmistakable Oriental ancestry shocked me so much that I did not really hear a thing he said to me at first. After a while I regained my composure, apologised profusely for my lapse in etiquette and inquired most eagerly from what source the elderly man, whom I respectfully addressed as Old Master (as I could have no doubt that it was he), was able to acquire knowledge of our people and of our language, and with such proficiency no less. The Old Master generously assuaged my anxiety, assuring me that no offence had been taken and promising to answer any question I had, beginning with the one I just asked.</p>
<p>He was indeed, he said, the same Old Master who left his people behind to pursue enlightenment in the wilderness and who was thought to be dead a very long time ago. Rather than dying, however, he chanced upon the same aedifice that we now found ourselves in after encountering a sandstorm not unlike the two that we suffered, which killed all of his companions. I asked him if the structure had been built by the gods or perhaps men of an ancient golden race, but this he did not answer and merely continued with his tale. At first he believed the structure to be a library of some sort, a compendium of wisdom that he may study and eventually bring back to his people to enlighten all of them. Eagerly entering the great hall, he was disappointed and dismayed to discover that the great hall had been wholly empty, with not a piece of paper inside and not a word engraved on its walls. Fate had, it seemed, played a cruel trick on him, and he angrily accosted Heaven (for it was the heavens conceived of as a purely spiritual entity that the Chinese believed in) for making him wasting so much of his energy only to die in this perfectly alien mausoleum. But he could not help but wander still further inside this great aedifice, in the hopes that the very emptiness of its halls may conceal some ultimate design that would give purpose to its existence. In this way days passed; then years. One day, eventually, he decided that he would strive no more and lay his body down on the floor. But as soon as he lay down he felt some object underneath his body, and upon instruction he found that it was a folded scroll upon which was inscribed a text in some incomprehensible language. Curiously, he unrolled the scroll to read it in its entirety; but as soon as he finished reading the text he was struck with a most debilitating pain and he found himself rendered completely blind. Just as his eyesight faded away from him, however, a most incredible and miraculous thing happened to this very ancient sage. Suddenly, he said, he felt himself seized and grasped away from the world in the way that one might pluck a hapless ant up from a piece of paper that it had hitherto recognised as its sole physical reality. Suddenly all of reality seemed to him no more than a mass of some incredibly complex shape, which can be beheld at a distance; not merely space, but indeed even time itself had released its tyrannical grasp on him, and suddenly he saw the world but as a continuous sequence of pictures at each point in time (he said it in this way no doubt to attempt to make me understand his very bizarre viewpoint, which I gather I cannot even begin to fathom in the least bit). Even logic, indeed, ceased to bind him in its rigorous dichotomy; at once numerous worlds unfolded before him, the ones where our basic logic laws held and the ones in which it failed to hold (which were so monstrously different from ours, he explained, that even to try to instil understanding of them by means of analogy was a lost cause), and similarly for more and more complex workings of logic, mathematics and natural philosophy. Now half of his speech I could not comprehend at all, since I had not a Greek education in which I believe they discussed the matter of logic at length, but I worked up the courage to ask a question that I was not sure if he would consider entirely silly. I wanted to know whether there might be a universe in which true things were false and vice versa; to this he laughed and nodded affirmatively, but did not explain, and in any case it satisfied me entirely to get a simple answer. He did not, after all, answer my question of how he had come to know the Latin language, but I gathered that the point he was trying to make was that he, in fact, knew all that was known and all that could have been known and all that could have been known about all that could have been known and so on. This last part, of course, I made up myself, but to a rustic soldier this was about the most I could understand about this ancient sage’s inscrutable teachings.</p>
<p>At this point I realised that the things he said and was about to say was plainly beyond me, so I asked him to tell me my fate, that of the other men who had been sent into the desert and that of the empires, since I reckoned that he had knowledge of all these things and the one thing I was most interested in was, of course, what would happen to me. To this he laughed again, and he assured me that my most anxious hopes would be granted and that I was to return to the world that I left behind when I crossed into the desert. In addition to this, he said, I would be returned to Rome eventually to tell of my story, but that this story would not be heard in over two thousand years. The others, he told me this too, had all perished by then, but few did from heat or hunger or thirst; the majority who did not die in the sandstorms simply killed each other off as their religious disputes inevitably turned violent. As for the fate of Rome, he said, she would dominate her own part of the world for hundreds of years at the cost of being herself dominated by capricious men, and that eventually the followers of a deceased Jew would usurp her power and dominate the world for a thousand year. He spoke in such a manner that these things seemed to be in the distant past, tales from another civilisation that he was merely recounting to me. After that he spoke cryptically and I could not understand much, but I was content enough to know about all these things that I did understand. Only then did I realise that, despite our conversation being carried out in Latin, my Chinese friend who entered the hall with me seemed to have comprehended it perfectly, as if everything that had been said was in his native language. The Old Master turned to him and asked whether he was ready, to which he nodded enthusiastically.</p>
<p>I was aware, then, that my role in whatever cosmic play that brought me to this alien land was over, and that the only scene that remained was for me to return. Before I left, however, I asked the Old Master what he planned to do next. I immediately regretted my usage of the word “plan”, since everything he told me seemed to disavow of such a thing ever existing, but this he did not seem to mind. Once the disciple (my Chinese friend, I gather) arrived at his doorsteps, he said, they would together go physically above the manifold fabric of reality, of space and time and logic and existence, where they would hold philosophical dialogues for all eternity (another word, he explained, used not literally but merely to produce the appropriate mental image in me). This saddened me slightly, for I had just grown fond of my new Chinese friend with whom I could not converse and of this ancient sage who spoke in poetical meter. The Old Master, however, did not share my sadness, which I think was not because he disliked me or wished me away, but rather because the word “eternity” was inappropriate still and one which he had only chosen because no Latin word accurately represented the concepts he talked about. In any case, I bid the two of them my farewell, and then I took my leave of them and stepped outside the hall. I was picked up immediately by a gush of wind, but not at all violent as the two sandstorms had been this time. It was, in fact, a somewhat pleasant feeling to feel himself, wearied by long walks in the desert, suddenly lightened and moved joyously about in the wind. I closed my eyes and allowed the wind to take me where it willed.</p>
<p>In what seemed like a few hours I was deposited by the wind at a place which I recognised at once as Carrhae, the site of the dreaded battle in which I was captured. Some Parthian soldiers saw me and, suspecting me of being a Roman spy, dragged me to their camp, where their commander at once recognised me as one of his captives sent into the desert. My appearance startled him greatly, for he had evidently been used to the entire expedition (if one could call it that) perishing inside the desert, and he eagerly asked me about my experience in the desert, hoping to extract some information of use. So I told him about the sandstorms, the disputes over religion, the incredible building and the ancient sage that dwelled within and his startling revelations, but the Parthian commander thought that I had simply gone mad. He dismissed me and instructed a few soldiers to escort me to and to settle me down with the other captured Roman soldiers, but we suffered a bandit attack on the way, from which I barely escaped with my life. Thereafter I wandered the landscape for many years, which took me from Carrhae all the way to the Persian coasts, until at last I was recognised in a village by another Roman veteran of my company, who had been on good terms with me before our captivity. He told me that I was incredibly fortunate to meet him at that precise time, for the Roman state had reached an agreement with Parthia to return us back to our homelands, and the general in charge of this affair promised to pay fifty gold pieces apiece to any man who elected to return. So in this way he identified me to the Parthian official who came to transport him, and I was brought back with him to Carrhae, where I was handed into your care.</p>
<hr />
<p>And so, my dear brother, everything that Gaius Carfulenus recounted to me I have transmitted to you without any mutilation, even though I was tempted several times to erase this rustic man’s defamation of our people’s arts and philosophy. There is another curious matter, however, which I had neglected to mention to you in the opening remarks in this letter. Agrippa was, upon reading this veteran’s most outlandish story, perplexed as to what we should do to this man; for he could not be killed or otherwise mistreated for fear of spoiling the victorious mission or of offending the gods who had blessed us with its success, but he certainly did not wish to allow him to spread his fanciful daydreams and delusions to the common people, who might even take the story literally and believe in such nonsense. This concern, however, turned out to be for naught; for soon the soldiers burst in and told us that Carfulenus mysteriously died in his chamber, in the presence of other veterans who had tended to him. He had been tranquil and wholly at peace before his death.</p>
<p>I would like to speak still more, brother, but time does not permit me to do so. For when it was found out that Carfulenus died, Agrippa instructed me to write a most moving and eloquent eulogy for him, praising his tenacity in surviving all these years and indicating with great sadness that the sight of his fatherland, from which he had been taken away for thirty years, was too much for the poor soldier to behold, and that he died shortly thereafter from sheer joy. About this matter I shall not speak again; may the Delphian Apollo bless both you and me, and perhaps the dying spirit of this Carfulenus as well, who shall hopefully find peace in the underworld at long last.</p>
<p>Farewell.</p>
