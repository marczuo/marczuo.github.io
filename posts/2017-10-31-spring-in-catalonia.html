<p>It’s not everyday that one gets to witness history in the form of a nation breaking free in the heart of western Europe—an event not seen at any rate since the end of the Second World War. All the more surprising is the fact that it is prosperous Catalonia leading the way instead of, as one might expect, some impoverished region far from the power centers of Europe and with nothing to lose by going for broke and declaring unilateral independence. But then, after what has been going on in the world for the past few years, perhaps it is overdue for our expectations to be adjusted for reality.</p>
<p>Europe certainly can’t be counted on to make that adjustment for itself. Already the techno-bureaucratic machinery underlying the EU has experienced a techno-malfunction trying to duck out and pretend that nothing is happening right on the southern border of its Franco-German core. But even the usual suspects, the ones we’re grown accustomed to when we talk about nationalism, have been conspicuously absent from the crisis in Catalonia. Britain, which might have been expected to exploit Catalonia as leverage in its own negotiations with Europe, has fallen rapidly in line with the bigwigs of Brussels, no doubt with an eye towards its own Scottish situation. Even such luminous continental Eurosceptics as the Le Pens and what have you, who would normally gladly seize on any occasion to rail at perceived EU injustices, have seemingly discovered a newfound aversion to publicity when it comes to the Catalans (so much for their “nationalism”). Beyond western Europe, the only criticism of the EU on a national level has been from autocrats (such as in Russia) and ethno-hegemonists (such as in Serbia) who are pointing out—rightly, unfortunately—that the EU has been applying double standards when it comes to secessionists within its borders and without. Conspicuously absent from their discourse, again, is any semblance of recognizing that maybe the Catalans do have a case for independence.</p>
<p>Little wonder, then, that Catalans have been perceived as fighting a lonely struggle. The news media has certainly amplified this perception: with little chance of being recognized internationally, independence has variously been called a “fool’s errand”, “self-defeating” and any number of sobriquets designed to make a passionate secessionist calm down and face “reality”. Such, at least, has been the implicit position of the core EU governments in Brussels, Paris and Berlin: the revolution must be crushed, so long as we don’t get our hands dirty. And indeed they do expect the revolution to be easily crushed—or else they would not have declined to intervene every step of the way.</p>
<p>But, even if we would have trusted them to know what they are doing in 2015, surely it is not so preposterous in 2017 to ask: do they? Whatever happened to the promise to build a Europe more compassionate, more responsive to and less out of touch with its people? It’s not difficult to guess: after a rookie Macron and a veteran Merkel respectively scored major victories for Team Brussels this year, any rhetoric for change has been replaced with what they have believed all along: “hey, we are doing well here, the status quo doesn’t need to be changed after all!” History, at least according to their worldview, marches on. The retrograde forces, whencesoever they have arisen, have been defeated. The movement towards centralization and a unitary state that would serve as a playground for Europe’s elite continues.</p>
<p>If only things were so simple. Perhaps Catalonia’s critics have their point that independence has been and still is an unattainable pipe dream—that is, if the rules of their game still apply. Those are the rules that proclaim the sanctity of the central state organs, of territorial integrity over the popular will to self-determination. But these very rules—laws handed down from heaven, it must seem to much of the EU bureaucracy—are shifting one way or another. Fundamental conflicts like that between Catalans and Spaniards don’t simmer down: they either keep brewing like under the Francoist regime, released in controlled, harmless ways (but never completely) like when autonomy was granted after Franco’s death, or boil over into a crisis like the present. Such is the nature of radically different peoples being kept even partially under the same regime—take Germans and Greeks, for example. The centralization of nation-states and suprastates like the EU in our time makes this inevitable. Either one gives up centralization or allows more states to be constituted—not likely when the liberal economic order demands efficiency above all things, and decentralization inevitably means less efficiency—or there must be oppression and injustice to some degree.</p>
<p>It is the hubris of Europe to believe that things could be otherwise, that diverse peoples could be brought under one central rule without oppression and the rebellion that it engenders. It is the hubris of Europe to believe that a country constituted under the form of a monarchical union in a time when the “central government” consists of a king to pledge and to hand over some tax money to can be shoehorned without change into the mold of a 21st century nation state, all the while congratulating itself that it is still the world’s moral authority on democracy and human rights. It is the hubris of Europe to applaud peoples of the world fighting for self-determination, but withhold the same from its own peoples, mumbling something about “the rule of law”—as if laws and even constitutions aren’t the product of political processes and social consent that they themselves are trying to obstruct—to justify itself. I know: many of us hesitate to criticize Europe too harshly because to do so is to be seen as giving ammunition to leaders who do far worse, but it is surely better to worship no idol at all than to pay homage to a false idol for want of anything else.</p>
<p>And perhaps the false idol is unraveling faster than any of us would expect. Catalonia would not be the last place where the assumptions of the technocratic elite of the EU come under challenge. To be sure, it is not at all clear that Catalonia will have the will to fight come what may: being such a prosperous region means that, while it has the spirit to be the first to rebel where a less well-to-do people might be content to remain in its place, it is also easily broken by a show of force. But there surely will be one day, if not in Catalonia, then somewhere we cannot even easily predict now, when the European leaders will have to choose between real changes and tanks in the streets of Barcelona just as they had been in Prague and in Budapest. The old emperor cannot wear his new clothes forever: behind the pride of Europe as a land of human rights there had better be some substance soon, or else risk the old continent being torn apart by conflict once again.</p>
<p>Spring is coming to Catalonia, even as the cold of winter is on the cusp of grasping these ancient lands in its unrelenting fist. What would happen afterwards is very much up in the air, whether the worst destructive tendencies of man is unleashed to provoke even more conflict and misery than we already have (just like in the aftermath of the Arab Spring), or if this is truly the beginning of a new deal that could serve as a model for justice for peoples in Europe and beyond. What is clear is that there is no longer an option for Europe to blindfold itself and pretend that everything is working out well, to engage in the self-destructive practice of destroying its own sociopolitical institutions in the name of preserving them. The time to think big is now: when the time comes when there is no other option but to think big, it may very well have been too late to preserve what decency there is left in the political system.</p>
