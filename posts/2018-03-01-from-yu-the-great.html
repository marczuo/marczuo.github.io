<p>There is a famous legend about the semi-mythic King Yu the Great of China that nearly every Chinese person has heard about. The story goes like this: during the reign of the pre-historic King Yao (dated to the second millennium B.C.), who ruled over the Yellow River civilization that is considered a precursor to historical China, frequent flooding of the Yellow River posed a threat to agriculture and prevented the economic and cultural developments that would later lead to the birth of Chinese civilization. King Yao thus ordered the engineer Gun to find a way to keep the floods under control, who designed and built a series of dams that he hoped might keep the river from flooding. The project, of course, ended up a failure: the flooding of the Yellow River proved too powerful to be held back by those primitive dams, and eventually the dams either collapsed or became useless when the waters overflowed them. After nine years, Gun admitted failure and was (depending on the story) either put to death by Yao or died in exile. The task now fell on the shoulders of Yu, the son of Gun and an engineer himself. Yu, realizing that it is more effective to take advantage of the terrain and give the floods a natural outlet, eschewed his father’s method of damming, dredged the riverbed and built irrigation canals along the course of the Yellow River that allowed floodwater to flow naturally into the canals instead of overflowing and drowning the fields. Yu’s project was a spectacular success, not only enabling agricultural growth in the Yellow River civilization that laid the foundation of Chinese civilization, but also giving himself a claim to the kingdom, so that, after the reigns of Yao and his successor Shun, Yu was himself proclaimed king and became, by traditional reckoning, the founding monarch of the first dynasty of China.</p>
<p>What I find interesting about this story is that, given the status of Yu (later acclaimed “Yu the Great”) as the traditional founding monarch of, essentially, the imperial age of China, this story can be regarded in a way as <em>the</em> Chinese aetiological myth, akin to the famous myths of Theseus of Athens, Perseus of Mycenae and Cadmus of Thebes. And, like all aetiological myths, the story of Yu the Great reveals to us the preoccupations of the ancient Chinese people: agriculture, for instance, figures prominently in the story, as are advances in hydraulic engineering represented in Yu’s innovations. But there is another way in which the story of Yu is revealing. Water, in traditional Chinese culture, is always symbolically associated with the common people. The early Confucian thinker Xunzi supposedly said that, “just as water is capable of sustaining a ship, so it is also capable of overturning and swallowing it.” Here, the “ship” is the exact same “ship of state” metaphor that appeared early in Western civilization, while the water of course represents the people. So, just as the people can sustain a monarch’s rule, so, too, can they rise up in rebellion and overthrow him if his misrule reaches a certain point. If we apply this metaphor to the story of Yu the Great, we get a fascinating new (and, some might say, mildly sinister) reading of the very old myth: instead of (or perhaps rather in addition to) literally representing Yu’s success in controlling the flood, perhaps his <em>real</em> innovation that permitted him to claim to be China’s first ruler is really the way he dealt with the common people: instead of treating the common people’s grievances with blunt state oppression, as Gun’s method of damming metaphorically represents, what Yu really discovered is that, as a ruler, you can get much more effective results if you used subtler methods. Perhaps we can say that Yu’s dredging of the riverbed represents covert methods such as censorship and propaganda—on the surface you can’t see any difference, but the undesirable sediments are taken away so that the water flows much more easily. Similarly, isn’t the digging of irrigation canals an apt metaphor of diverting the people’s attention? Either through mindless entertainment, or through inducing pointless factional infighting, the people’s attention is redirected elsewhere, so that their anger is kept under control and won’t swell up to, as Xunzi would say, overturn the ship of state. How similar this is to our supposedly “modern” ways of maintaining state authority and thwarting the possibility of popular uprisings against the state!</p>
<p>Our new reading of the story of Yu the Great thus gives us two layers of meaning woven into one story: first, the literal sense which says that a good monarch ought to be able to provide his subjects with food, and a second, metaphorical sense which says that a good monarch should give his subjects outlets to release their discontent and thereby prevent it from boiling to the point of rebellion. Isn’t this precisely the famous Roman <em>panem et circenses</em> that the satirical poet Juvenal wrote about? Indeed, if there is one thing Chinese history teaches us, it is that monarchs who respected these precepts usually had prosperous reigns, while those who let their libidinous enjoyments get ahead of themselves and failed in one (or, more usually, both) of these departments usually met gruesome ends not only for themselves, but quite often for the dynasties they represented. Thus the story of Yu is doubly significant as a kind of “constitution” for imperial China: give the people food, keep their attention diverted. That’s your job as a king, or later an emperor of China. But, one may fairly ask, does this blueprint for a successful state only apply to imperial China in the mold of Yu the Great, or is it applicable even today, even in Western liberal democratic and capitalist societies? My answer is yes. For, indeed, doesn’t capitalism and democracy map to both of these precepts? Capitalism is what has enabled rapid economic growth and improvement in living standards (the <em>panem</em>), while liberal democracy has in two ways provided an unprecedented means of diverting the people’s attention: first, through the proliferation of choices of entertainment enabled by a liberal society; and secondly through voters’ participation in government which gives them a sense of being included in the political process. In these ways, liberal democracy shows itself to correspond exactly to the <em>circenses</em> of Juvenal and to the metaphorical sense of the story of Yu the Great.</p>
<p>It is ironic, then, that it has taken China all these years from its plunge into modernity (arguably during the First Opium War of 1839) to Deng Xiaoping’s reforms (in the 1980s and 1990s) for it to embrace fully the modern incarnation of the very precepts of Yu the Great that lie at the foundation of Chinese civilization. The teacher, in the end, had to be taught by the students. But once China has embraced these two institutions (cautiously, of course; its capitalism has always been a capitalism under heavy state control, while it tried to adopt a version of liberalism without democracy after the protests of 1989), it has experienced an explosive growth the likes of which the world never witnessed before; to borrow a common Chinese folk saying, the older ginger root is always spicier than the younger. Indeed, while the languishing of post-Cold War Russia under Putin’s kleptocracy is ignored by the panegyrists of capitalism, China’s meteoric rise—however problematic its spin on capitalism and liberal democracy turned out to be for fundamentalists of both concepts—was until a few years ago hailed as the definitive proof of the popular 1990s thesis of the “end of history”, as Francis Fukuyama put it. Capitalism and liberal democracy, to recap, are thought to be the final, most evolved stage of history (of, we might say, Yu’s legacy), and any change from them must necessarily be a decline. Under this thesis, China just had to go that one last step towards fully embracing capitalism and liberal democracy to realize its historical destiny of being the world’s superpower, eclipsing a temporary period of American hegemony; and the only thing holding it back was an elite circle of Communist Party elders who saw in full democracy an unacceptable loss of power, and perhaps the danger of a reckoning for their misuse of power for private enrichment. Once they are safely out of the way, goes the thinking, that’s when democracy and greatness alike would finally come to China.</p>
<p>In a way, the past two or three years or so have been a period of traumatic reckoning not for the Chinese Communist Party elders—but for those of us who wholeheartedly and uncritically embraced that thesis. Even as the world is finally beginning to emerge from the recession that began in 2008, the future of this combination of capitalism and liberal democracy is appearing much less certain than it did back then, ten years ago. Developments like the so-called “sharing economy” that destroyed employment security, the further erosion of the welfare state everywhere (in particular in austerity-ridden Europe, where even the IMF is powerless to stop the diktats of conservative German austerocrats), and above all sharply rising income inequality fueled by the economic recovery have so destabilized Western countries that it is almost unimaginable for the US President to lecture his Chinese part any more. Not that he would have the desire to—the kind of neo-liberal, centrist leadership that once laid the foundation of this modern combination of capitalism and liberal democracy has lost the confidence of the common people to such an extent that voters everywhere are in a rush to enthrone iconoclastic strongmen who would have no truck with this globalist ideal of the whole world united in a common vision of liberal democracy. And what about China, which was to become a beacon of liberal democratic capitalism and eclipse Western Europe and America to take leadership of the world? What we have instead is the self-coronation of a new monarch for life in the person of President Xi Jinping, who beyond all his predecessors has succeeded in clearing up the corrupt old men of the Party <em>nomenklatura</em>, concentrated power in his person at the expense of the collective rule system Deng instituted and, in a <em>coup de grace</em> against the old Party elites and proponents of liberal democracy alike, finished his five-year plan for personal power grab by abolishing the term limit for the presidency and effectively making himself president for life. So much for the notion that China will make an unavoidable transition into democracy, when what actually happened is a retrogradation into what essentially amounts to monarchy, as President Xi remakes himself in the mold of a great and benign authoritarian leader, a “Xi the Great” for our modern age, perhaps.</p>
<p>How, then, to make sense of what we are seeing on the global stage? I think it is quite instructive to refer back to the story of Yu as a kind of <em>point de départ</em> for our analysis. Note that, in the story of Yu, we are presented with two alternatives for controlling the Yellow River’s flooding: either we follow Gun, building dams to stop the water in its course, or we follow Yu and divert the water into canals to prevent it from gathering in one place and causing a flood. But doesn’t this very choice presume that the river is not a force whose autonomy is to be respected, but rather something to be controlled, tamed, even remade to further our human ends (for, indeed, the canals Yu dug out served a double purpose of enabling agricultural development away from the main course of the Yellow River)? This very realization shatters a fundamental belief held by democratic romantics, for whom democracy is, or at least is supposed to be an authentic expression of the people’s will, which will at last reign supreme after being subjugated to tyrants for most of the duration of history. But doesn’t the lesson of Yu the Great tell us something quite different about liberal democracy, one which is more sober and, I think, is the real reason why liberal democracy prevailed in a world that works essentially on principles of <em>Realpolitik</em>? Here, as we have briefly touched on before, liberal democracy is revealed in its true mode of operation, which is to divert the people’s attention, to fragment it, to turn its fury around and make it subservient to the very system it is supposed to be against. In essence, Western liberal democracy serves an ideological role not too different from the propaganda machines of the Soviet Union and of pre-reform China, only one which operates on the principles of Yu rather than that of Gun. And, in this capacity, it was certainly successful, enabling the West to triumph over the Communist bloc in the Cold War and giving us memorable images of people from the formerly Communist countries rushing rapturously to embrace a world in which, they mistakenly believed, they will be free at last: free from oppression, free from ideology.</p>
<p>Yet of course this elevation of the people above “mere ideology” is an illusion—as Althusser said, “ideology has always already interpellated individuals as subjects.” To return to the story of Yu, one choice that was <em>not</em> presented to us—and thus presented to us in its <em>absence</em>—is that of simply submitting to the river. If the river floods, then we simply accept its logic and structure our lives around it, accepting such unpleasant outcomes such as starving to death (thus preventing inter-generational accumulation of capital) or having to adopt a different lifestyle that may not be as amenable to further developing a sedentary civilization. The very <em>radical exclusion</em> of this possibility, which of course would have been ruled out quite immediately by King Yao (“what do you mean we should just let the river be and accept its capriciousness? I want more subjects working to fill my treasury, and you <em>will</em> do what I say or die, damn it!”), is the exclusion of a true recognition of the people’s autonomous will. This <em>mode of seeing</em> the people in terms of instrumentality underlies and permeates liberal democracy in spite of its ideological narrative of truly respecting the people’s will, which in reality is, of course, already ruled out beforehand as in Yu’s story. And it is this underlying mode, this enframing, which in some cases is consciously felt and sometimes simply unconsciously held as a pre-condition of the liberal democracy ideological view of the world, which coupled with the capitalist imperative of eternal growth assures the mutual degeneracy of the system as a whole. Because liberal democracy works in tandem (however much it might appear the opposite way), and not as a check on the impulse of the worst tendencies of capitalism to exacerbating class division, it is simply doomed to repeat the same process of ideological degeneration that assured the destruction of every dynasty in Chinese history. What is this ideological degeneration? To take the Tang dynasty, arguably the most prosperous dynasty in China’s history, as our example, we see a very clear degeneration of the integrity of the ideological fantasy from the reign of Emperor Taizong, who was able to adeptly project an image of the Tang court as a benevolent assurer of the people’s economic welfare, to a clear breakdown of this ideological fantasy during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong, who, despite a popular beginning to his reign, gradually squandered the people’s goodwill when he shed this Yu-ian ideological image and became known for his profligacy and his licentiousness in the later years of his reign. Is it any surprise, then, that the An–Shi Rebellion broke out under his watch, thoroughly destroying the state bureaucracy of the Tang dynasty and starting a long process of dissolution of Tang authority?</p>
<p>This kind of ideological degeneration is exactly what we are seeing in the case of our own capitalist, liberal democratic civilization, which as we have discussed above can be seen as our society’s own interpretation of Yu the Great’s twofold way of assuring the perpetuation of state power. The election of Trump in the US is perhaps a watershed moment akin to the An–Shi Rebellion, if one can be found, in our own process of ideological degeneration; not only is his electoral campaign quite explicitly built on a questioning of liberal democracy—from questioning liberalism in his frequent and quite overt assaults on, say, freedom of speech, to questioning democracy in his frequent suggestion that elections are all rigged and that he would not have recognized any victory of his opponents—but, even more importantly, his administration, like the later years of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, has labored assiduously to abandon even the ideological pretense of liberal democracy in favor of a sheer, raw version of breakneck capitalism which would please the most fundamentalist disciple of neo-liberalism (who, ironically, universally despised Trump for undermining their ideological fantasy). The hyper-optimistic “end of history” theory, too, is thus placed under a UV light that exposed their ideological casing and, consequently, has vanished into thin air, leaving only a huge, gaping void. Of course, the Trump administration does offer some form of ideology; ideology is, indeed, as inevitable as its need to not appear <em>qua</em> ideology. But this ideology could not be more different from liberal democracy; it is a combination of undisguised capitalism, strongman rule and white identity politics, ironically using the means first pioneered by the neo-liberal left (the oft-derided “PC left”). None of these, it is clear, represents an ideology in its non-degenerate stage as liberal democracy can be said to be for our modern age; they are merely the last gasp of an ideology already made degenerate by the relentless pressure of its more sinister companion, unrestrained capitalism.</p>
<p>All of this is precisely why it is imperative that we pay attention to developments in Beijing spearheaded by Xi Jinping, or Xi the Great as he might be called now; the failure of the dual ideology of capitalism-liberal democracy that China (partially and belatedly) adopted sheds light on his actions as far from, as a naïve viewer might simplistically conclude, a mere authoritarian power grab, but rather something more reflective of our times and our present situation on a global scale. Quite like Trump, Xi has dismissed liberal democracy (which the post-Deng Chinese Communist Party has never enthusiastically embraced anyway) in its ideological role; but what does he offer in its place? It is here that Xi has gone a step further than Trump. In the absence of a credible ideology—either that of liberal democracy or that of orthodox Maoist Communism—Xi’s natural move is to revert to the original, pre-modern form of ideology incarnated in his person; in short, strongman rule in its logical conclusion of monarchy. But it is also unlike the strongman rule of Mao Zedong, as some commentators believe to be the case; the crucial difference is precisely as we have discussed above; where Mao’s rule was couched in an ideology—Maoist Communism—that offered a coherent worldview not yet tainted by degeneration and was engaged in a global ideological struggle with liberal democracy not unlike a kind of father-son showdown between Gun and Yu. Xi’s rule, on the other hand, is much more ambiguous in an age of ideological degeneration; it is true that strongman rule has in recent years been taken up by a variety of petty despots the world over, from Putin to Erdoğan to Maduro; what is worrying, however, is the rapidity with which the world’s two most powerful states, the US and China, has hurtled down this path of nihilism and of ideological degeneration. When, in the 20th century, Western Marxist theorists had the luxury of sitting back, taking their time to think about what kind of ideology they want to build after the demise of capitalism and liberal democracy, it seems that the time is running out for us today. “What will happen, after all this farcical ideological degeneration is over? Who will take over? Who will offer a vision that will replace liberal democracy?” It is perhaps for this reason ideological dystopias are becoming more and more popular today, as the TV success of <em>Man in the High Castle</em> and <em>Handmaid’s Tale</em> evinces; if those of us who are concerned with human freedom and welfare don’t manage to answer those questions, and soon, those who do manage to answer them may be very far from the kind of people we would want in charge of us.</p>
