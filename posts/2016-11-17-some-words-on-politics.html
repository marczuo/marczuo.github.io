<p>On the election of Donald J. Trump to the presidency of the United States more words have perhaps been spoken, more articles written than I can keep track of. The victors have had days to gloat, the losers to mourn and to assign blame, and everyone to contemplate the state of American politics as well as that of the world, and to proffer reasonings for the electoral outcome that took the world by surprise. Inevitably, the familiar narratives emerge from this cacophony of voices: “Clinton was too toxic to win.” “Not so, because Sanders would have been even more of a turn-off to independents.” “Neoliberalism is dying and taking the world with it.” “Not so, the economy is doing as well as it could be expected to, and everyone is so much more better off than the pre-neoliberal era. This is all about neo-fascism and a racist backlash against multiculturalism.” And so on and so on.</p>
<p>Yet analyses of the electoral result along such superficial lines hardly stand any deeper scrutiny. Yes, Hillary Clinton was seen as secretive and untrustworthy to many. The last-moment blowing up of her email story no doubt made up some people’s minds. Yet Trump is hardly a shining beacon for transparency, and it’s not like his opponents were too lenient in pursuing this line of attack. His tax returns still fail to materialize, and it’s all but a certainty at this point that he participated in legal tax evasion, that favorite neoliberal élite’s tool to bolster their economic welfare at the expense of the poor, to a far greater extent than any politician before. Similarly, responding to the Sandersites’ argument that their senator would have defeated Trump, the Clintonites’ favorite riposte is to make reference to his socialist background and various things such as his notorious “rape” essay; all, they concede, are completely understandable and not such egregious offences when put in context, but will the Republicans and Donald Trump even allow him to put these things in context? And can’t the same be said of Hillary Clinton and her emails, when they still, goes the counter-argument, cost her the election?</p>
<p>But this line of reasoning, like the one before it, breaks down when one considers that the exact same applies to Donald Trump. The Republicans have a thick opposition research file on Sanders, a Newsweek article menacingly reminds us. And yet, I do want to know, is the Democrats’ opposition research file on Trump thin by comparison? What even are the supposed dirt spots in Sanders’s personal history in comparison to those in Trump’s? “Well, sure, but Trump isn’t a politician, so the rules didn’t apply to him.” Tell me, prithee, why do you think that is the case? Do non-politicians come to the race automatically exempt from all norms of behavior? That cannot be the case. If the rules of decency and of political gravity failed to pull Trump down and prevent him from victory, it must be owing not to who he is but to something he is offering. And what he’s offering has to do with the economy. Naturally enough, it has to do with that word all the pundits are buzzing around: neoliberalism.</p>
<p>Neoliberalism is dying, so goes the thesis; policies of free market economy and free trade can no longer guarantee the economic welfare of individuals, who are quietly rebelling by turning out to elect Trump in the midwestern states that propelled him to victory. But wait a minute, others may say. Living standards, despite all the doom and gloom, has improved. Technology brings us new conveniences in our life. And the economy, however badly it suffered in the recession, will rebound in due time; most crucially of all, the defenders of the neoliberal policies would say, they still represent the best hope we have of growth and will make everyone better off than they could have in another system. After all, this was the system that managed to replace both welfare-based social democracy in the western world and communism in, well, the communist bloc. Going back to the “bad old days” thus seems like a genuine step backwards, according to this view, and should be ascribed to a failure of democracy, to an all-too-impressionable electorate being misled by neo-fascists and those who would exploit their worst racist tendencies to make them choose against their own interest.</p>
<p>Democracy, it is true enough, often leads to objectively bad, impulsive decisions just like a person of ill temper. Its principal virtue lies in its ability to mitigate political tension—and there’s certainly a lot of it in contemporary US politics—and to prevent civil strife. In a different system, we could easily be staring down a peasant rebellion over their economic circumstances. Instead, they get a chance at electing someone who ostensibly voices their concerns—more on the “ostensible” part later. Are their concerns legitimate or justified, or are they mostly an outcome, as some may contend, of the media, mainstream or extreme, droning on day after day that all is not well in America, which left them with a warped vision of their economic status? I submit that this later view, though not without merit, understates the reality of the economic suffering endured by many.</p>
<p>It is true, for instance, that most people are living materially better lives than they otherwise could have. It is also true that many of the rebelling, Trumpist voters are better off than many of the minorities and immigrants they are attacking, who are not even responsible for the system in the first place. Yet none of these arguments delegitimize the Trumpist voters’ concerns. For one thing, most people—I daresay all of us—live in the present, that which is; we naturally contextualize our economic welfare in the actual economy where power flows to the techno-financial élite, while few would go around and say “gee, I’m just thankful I’m not living in a communist country like North Korea” (and they are probably sarcastic if they did). Secondly, it doesn’t take away from the basic grievances of the Trumpist voters if they are angry at the wrong people. If X stole a thousand dollars from me, and I, mistakenly thinking that Y did it, took her to task instead of the true culprit, it certainly does not mean that I was not justified to complain that I just had a thousand dollars stolen from me. And, of course, even if Y actually just had ten thousand stolen from her, I’m still justified to complain about what happened to me, am I not? (Naturally, this analogy does not suggest that something simplistically comparable to stealing is occurring in the economy. However, this being not an essay on that issue, I’ll simply make the analogy and move on.)</p>
<p>Neoliberalism, in other words, cannot be simplistically said to be dying or well. It is well in the sense that it is working exactly as it’s supposed to, exactly for the reasons why it was introduced on the global stage, and—as anyone can check for themselves—it is doing well by the standards it sets itself; the economy really is recovering, the pie really is getting bigger. It is dying in the sense that it always have been, namely because it had the present conflict coded in its very DNA and, by nature, will fail a large swath of the population—among which are both the Trumpist voters in the midwest and the diehard Democrats among inner city minorities—in terms of economic equality. The state of health of neoliberalism is not materially different today than when it was first introduced; all that differs is that people who used to accept its premises are now taking up arms.</p>
<p>Sure, technological advances make a lot of what happened to them economically inevitable. Short of nullifying years of technological developments, for instance, we probably won’t succeed in reversing the trend of the world to become smaller and of competition to become globalized. This brings us to the part where Trump’s victory is only a superficial win for the distressed Trumpist voters and why it represents a failure of democracy after all. Trump, in other news, despite being the anti-establishment candidate who was going to torpedo received wisdoms and blaze a way forward for those deprived of their voice politically, presents what could accurately be described as a model neoliberal agenda on the economic side, sans free trade. Tax cuts are going to the rich; financial regulations are going to get scrapped just the way the techno-financial élite like it. The system is still going to favor the winners of neoliberalism, and all that has changed is a possible renunciation of global leadership in trade. (And I say possible, because apparently even this is negotiable to the Donald.)</p>
<p>Besides this, Trump has promised, according to one or two news sources, some sort of stimulus and possibly a jobs programme. The economic implications of this may be studied by economists, but no possible proposal can amount to overturning the assumptions underlying the rest of his policies, the ones which may well have been drafted by Reagan and Thatcher and Bill Clinton and the Bushs. (And if, as the news currently reports, he does decide to elevate his son-in-law—whose background is impeccably mired in the establishment of the élite—to an important position, it seems like we may expect even less deviation from Republican neoliberal establishment policy-making.) The change candidate will give us no change in the one thing that matters, which propelled him to electoral victory, namely the economy. Of course, even this morsel is preferable to many to Hillary Clinton, the arch-neoliberal in economic matters, as the election demonstrated. But what’s concerning is that the election of Trump, an improbable expression of outrage at politics-as-usual, will in all likelihood result in, well, politics-as-usual (after, that is, the effects of the superficial band-aids he throws onto the status quo fade off and the continued underlying application of neoliberal thinking becomes apparent, which may in some scenarios take us through 2020 and give Trump two terms to govern). If even Trump cannot deliver the desired changes, then who will? How much will people trust democratic processes and how well will they continue to ward off civil strife?</p>
<p>There is a common refrain among some quarters that our present day is taking shape to resemble the late Roman Empire, with its population movements and fall of centralized imperial power. This belief is, I contend, not all that accurate until the time when aliens arrive from outer space and start building settlements on Earth. On the other hand, at least from a political-economic perspective, the internal circumstances of (earthly) western countries are shaping up to resemble remarkably the late Roman Republic. If that analogy holds, then we must take note of one of the lessons it offers us; namely, that only someone with a coherent vision, an integral philosophy to replace that of the old guard, not someone who merely responds to the needs du jour of the people and the last manifestation of their discontent, can bring about lasting change. So people like Pompey and Crassus, powerful though they may be, and though they not infrequently came to clash with establishment politics and all championed popular causes from time to time, could never have built a new order (though the latter, admittedly, got himself killed in a disastrous military expedition before he could have tried). Both men, it was evident, cared for glory and power in itself; neither cared actually about resolving popular discontent, and, as Pompey actually did, would have allied themselves with the old guard the moment it was the likelier path to domination and eternal glory.</p>
<p>By now, this description probably sounds suspiciously familiar and can easily be applied to a certain politician of the present day. That beneath the superficiality of the changes Trump is prepared to bring to Washington lies yet more politics-as-usual is a natural result of his lack of vision. Insofar as democracy failed us, it did not fail us by rejecting the candidate of status quo; it failed us by accepting a sham, a mirage which, be it in four or eight years, will finally result in the recognition that nothing has changed in how the American political establishment conducts its business. All of the doom and gloom talk that followed Trump’s election may have reason—but now is not the time. Come the day when Trump has been exposed for the insincere agent of change that he is, we may see a true test for American democracy and its well-deserved reputation for defusing political impasses and responding quickly to discontent.</p>
<p>Which, of course, brings us to whether and how we may find a way out. When the Roman Republic’s fatal conflict between the oligarchic élite and the people, who felt increasingly disenfranchised, was finally resolved by Julius Caesar and Octavian, it was with centralized power and the ability of the ensuing imperial political apparatus to distribute political and economic power beyond the traditional élite (which was, not without reason, denounced as tyranny by Caesar’s nemesis and defender in chief of the oligarchy, Cato the Younger). We, in the 21st century, may have reason to hope that a better arrangement—one that isn’t plagued with its own deficiencies and contradictions to a similar extent—can eventually be found. Among the Democrats, some hope of change may be found in Bernie Sanders’s retrospection on social democracy before it was replaced by neoliberal free trade, free market and deregulation; nevertheless, he and his supporters will have to work out how any of his policies will work out given the state of the technology-driven economy of the present world. What Trump’s unexpected win does mean is that one can forget about the Clintonites’ shrieking at the thickness of the Republican opposition research book on Sanders and/or any of his successors, or any similar reservations about “electorability” or the such. “It’s the economy, stupid,” and anyone who forgets about it sails on precarious waters.</p>
