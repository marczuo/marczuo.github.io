<p>A little over a week ago, David S. Buckel, a well-respected American human rights lawyer, committed suicide by self-immolation in Brooklyn to protest our continued use of fossil fuel. His tragic death, as we all know, was reported all over national media, stirred up a sober national conversation and deep soul-searching on our part, and ultimately shifted our societal consensus vis-à-vis energy policy to taking more seriously the prospects of environmental destruction and favoring renewable energy in a bid to secure a brighter future for future generations…</p>
<p>Just kidding; no such thing happened, of course. The tragedy itself, mind you, really did take place: Buckel really killed himself on a warm Saturday morning by burning himself alive in Prospect Park. And, given the note he left, he probably really hoped earnestly that, through his action, something akin to the sequence of events described in the previous paragraph would have happened and changed our world for the better. If so, then what actually transpired in response to his death has thoroughly dashed his high hopes: far from shocking people into seriously confronting the issue of fossil fuel use, his death ended up a brief blip in local news headlines, buried under mountains upon mountains of breathless reportage of politicians’ private lives, and forgotten almost as soon as it had happened by the national consciousness. Worse, not only is his suicide almost completely passed over in silence by the national media, what few buzzes it generated was drowned out by outraged voices—outraged, that is, not at fossil fuel use or anything remotely related to the cause that Buckel passionately embraced, but at the simple fact that a suicide was reported in such a way that it could conceivably be considered heroic by some. How utterly irresponsible! These self-righteous moral guardians lament. What if someone were to read about Buckel in the news and, God forbid, come to decide that killing themselves is the right thing to do? How dare the media put at risk the lives of poor, poor mentally ill people who could easily be persuaded to commit suicide by reports of this kind?</p>
<p>To me, there can be no question that this sort of reaction to news reports of Buckel’s untimely death is the real tragedy issuing from the sequence of events he put into action; more tragic than his suicide itself and more tragic even than the total lack of attention paid to the cause he had championed. And, if we may pause for a bit and consider the ample amount of historical parallels to Buckel’s shocking action, we must marvel at what a thoroughly modern reaction this is. Rooted, too, in a uniquely Christian sensibility that gives lie to our pretensions to a tolerant, universal vision of secularism; for history is full of examples of civilizations that glorified precisely the sort of suicide that today’s moral guardians would forbid the glorification of, without actually producing the result they warn us about—namely a rise in the sort of senseless suicide resulting from the proverbial boredom of modernity. We need only to give a few examples: Buckel’s chosen means of suicide itself, for instance, echoes deliberately the Buddhist practice of self-immolation to protest some injustice in society. In feudal Japan, too; while the stereotypical samurai who willingly and gladly commits <em>harakiri</em> in order to avoid dishonor is perhaps not in every case borne out in reality, there can be no doubt that a warrior who actually embraces this institution and casts aside our deeply-ingrained fear of death is put into a position of glory in the popular imagination. Thoroughly ridiculous, by contrast, is the imagery of a benevolent observer regretting the mental illness of the Tibetan Buddhists or the Japanese warriors that drove them to kill themselves and moralizing on the necessity of avoiding their glorification in order to combat “the public health epidemic of suicide” or some such nonsense.</p>
<p>And, even in the western world, the perception of suicide before the advent of Christian culture was vastly different from today’s benevolent moral guardians. In Greco-Roman culture, someone who is capable of committing suicide was seen as deserving of the highest praise even if they were otherwise flawed; the fact that they could rise above the instinct of self-preservation was seen as definitive proof of moral rectitude and worthy of the highest kind of glorification. Thus Cato the Younger, for instance, earned for himself the praise of people who were otherwise outside his camp of support and even the grudging respect of his enemies, when he refused to flee or surrender after losing to Caesar’s legions in the civil war and committed suicide at Utica instead; so, too, did Augustan propagandists who painted Cleopatra as the antithesis to every Roman moral value regard her suicide with approval as an act of manly bravery: in Horace’s Ode 1.37, his famous account of the triumph over Antony and Cleopatra, the queen who was otherwise <em>fortunaque dulci ebria</em> (“drunk with the sweet wine of fortune”) and plotting <em>dementis ruina</em> (“mad ruination”) for Rome with her <em>contaminato […] grege turpium morbo virorum</em> (“vile throng of men befouled with illness”), who was a <em>fatale monstrum</em> (“fatal monstrosity”), was, as soon as she saw her defeat coming and decided to take her own life instead, elevated almost into a heroic figure: she did not <em>muliebriter expavit ensem</em> (“fear the sword like a woman”) but was, in the end, a <em>non humilis mulier</em> (“no lowly woman”) above the pettiness of Rome’s <em>superbo triumpho</em> (“arrogant triumph”). Poor Augustus! We cannot help but exclaim. If his propagandists had the ideological conviction of today’s folk psychiatrists who are ever-so-ready to problematize suicide as purely a mental health issue, can we not imagine them having the final laugh when they found Cleopatra’s lifeless body? “Ah, such a poor woman to have succumbed to her mental illness like this; she could have fought bravely and not given in to despair and taken her own life!” Is this sort of contempt poorly dressed up as concern not a thousandfold more violent and less magnanimous than even the most brutal proscription under the reign of Augustus? Not only in death does it leave one well alone, but rather continues to do violence.</p>
<p>I do not mean to say, of course, that societies like Tibet, Japan or ancient Rome consider suicide to be a genuinely good thing and encouraged its pursuit; no societies, except for the briefest ones, could have done so for the obvious reason; Jonestown makes this fact rather clear. That those peoples admired the tragic heroes who commit suicide by no means make suicide less bad; it was precisely because it is such a bad thing which the tragic hero embraced anyway that made them tragic heroes. In fact, far from accusing these societies for trivializing suicide through their glorification of it, we must accuse modern society instead for the same charge precisely because, by reducing suicide into a pure mental health problem, we have taken away the trauma of such an unthinkable act and rehabilitated it as a symptom of an illness no different in kind, though perhaps in intensity, from sneezing when one has a cold. In Lacanian terms, what is lacking from our conception of suicide as opposed to the Tibetans, the Japanese and the ancient Romans is the Real of suicide; far from treating the event in all its proper traumatic intensity, the modern person’s relationship to suicide is much too domesticated, too familiar as to be divorced from the messy world of subjectivity of the Other but reduced to the shallowness of mechanical causality: your brain has some bad wirings; now you are mentally ill; now you have killed yourself as a result. The benevolent moral guardian outraged at anything that might trigger this mechanical effect fancies herself a lab-coated alien scientist observing humans like our biologists would observe ants: introduce such and such a stimulus, and susceptible individuals end up killing themselves. Is this completely sterile notion of human existence not of the same sort as the worst inhuman monstrosities committed by mankind, not far removed from the morbid curiosity of Nazi doctors unleashing their most twisted designs upon innocent prisoners, but merely applying itself towards an ostensibly “humanist” end of preventing suicides?</p>
<p>The truth is that it is precisely this kind of domesticated view of suicide that drives our modern alienation from authentic self-expression and towards the kind of boredom and insipid existence that has paradoxically lead to an increasingly high proportion of people looking to kill themselves. It is not suicide itself we are trying to bar away, to abrogate when we adopt the mental health theory of suicide, but suicide in its unbearably traumatic kernel of the Real, the properly inhuman aspect of this act of utter self-negation that momentarily rips a hole in our elaborate Symbolic construction of such quotidian notions as humanism, as utilitarian notions of political activism (many, indeed, faulted Buckel for killing himself when it is obvious that he could have done more good by staying alive), et cetera. The Real of suicide resists our attempts to understand it from the predominant Symbolic fiction of our society—of every society, in fact, save for such prominent aberrations as Jonestown, and it is precisely for this reason that in so many diverse societies has there been a certain kind of glorification of suicide; it is the nearly divine aspect of this total renunciation of what being human consists of that leads to the act being respected as having a certain truth-revealing function not unlike the kind of divine revelation familiar to world religions. This is why the uniquely modern conception of suicide as purely a mental health issue is itself a perfect example of the Foucauldian notion of madness being an instrument of ideological power and control; the subject is mad precisely when her actions exceed the boundaries set by the prevailing ideological apparatus of a given society, and the means by which society keeps this kind of rebellion under control is not so much through its stigmatization by itself but through a characterization of this constructed “madness” as a natural illness to be cured; it is not repression, but rather humanitarian concern, that effectively does the most violence to the subject branded as “mad”, because it deprives her of even the dignity of being a sufferer of repression and re-conceives her of a totally pathetic object deserving only of pity… The proper imagery here is that of Neo when he was first captured by Agent Smith in the beginning of the film <em>The Matrix</em>; rather than being given the dignity of being repressed by, say, Men in Black operating above the law who respond to his request for a phone call with threats and physical abuse, Agent Smith has an even easier way of bringing him in line—what good, indeed, is a phone call if you are unable to speak? And what good is killing yourself to protest an injustice, if you’ll only be seen as no more dignified than the innumerable people who die of cancer or heart disease every day, just another tragic victim of a deadly disease?</p>
<p>Indeed, something like this is exactly what happened to Buckel after his death, which is what I have called above the real tragedy here; however well-meaning those who call for the suppression of Buckel’s suicide note on account of the possibility it might inspire future suicides are, their action itself must be properly inscribed in the unexamined ideological background of a certain humanist sensibility indivisible from Christian civilization as well as a tendency, as analyzed by Foucault, to view suicide as a specimen of “madness” purely from a medical perspective, in terms of mental health, which conceals the very ideological presumption that had constructed the notion of madness itself. The inevitable end result is a suppression of any political impetus that may have rendered his suicide meaningful in the first place, a fleeing away from the controversial politics of environmental protection his suicide was supposed to blow open in its traumatic intensity. What Buckel failed to take into account is how much we, as a society, have conditioned ourselves to repress the potential of a traumatic act such as a protest by suicide to uncover the horizon of political discourse and instead have re-inscribed such an act as a personal medical problem, something totally mundane and unchallenging for the rest of us. Is this not what truly lies underneath the explosion of boredom and suicide in modern society and not the supposed glorification of suicide that is the reporting of Buckel’s death? Life is only worth living, if it is open to radical self-negation and if its willing negation actually meant something; this is a lesson that pertains not only to feudal Japan but to all warrior cultures like Mycenean Greece, Sparta or Vedic India, and the fact that these societies can often strike us as callously undervaluing human lives is, quite ironically, the very proof that human lives are, in some sense, valued in those societies above anything we could rationally assign in our own. That Buckel killed himself and no one batted an eye except to regret his “illness” speaks in no way to how much <em>his</em> life is worth to us, as one might have assumed—rather, it speaks volumes about exactly how much <em>our own</em> lives are really worth in our contemporary society—not very much, as it turns out.</p>
<p>Further, is not the same reduction of the great traumatic potential for change in an act of self-negation such as Buckel’s suicide to the epidemic “suicide from boredom” that plagues today’s developed societies not connected to our wider inability to accept self-negation in the form of genuine devotion to a cause to the point of self-sacrifice? In opposition to Badiouan pseudo-events today such as the rise of the alt-right and its concomitant movements, the hidden anti-humanist side of liberal humanist ideology much like the proverbial other head of Janus, there is only a desert of neoliberal nihilist ideology in its many guises that, even when it allies itself to truly progressive goals such as combating climate change, has, as its response to Buckel’s suicide has shown, failed to rise to the height of the event and thus resigned itself to total political inefficacy. Ironically, then, the reproach previously mentioned which argues that Buckel could have done more good by staying alive can be turned on its head: I am of course not saying that Buckel should have done what he did, but the real inefficacy here lies not in his action itself but in his ostensible allies’ failure to grasp its significance. It was no less a figure as Immanuel Kant who, commenting on the French Revolution and its nightmarish aftermath in the shape of <em>La Terreur</em>, argued that the Revolution acquired its true significance not because of what happened in France but because of what sympathetic observers all over Europe saw in it, because, despite all the bad things that happened in the name of the Revolution, despite all the cold, utilitarian calculuses according to which it would have been better for the Revolution not to have happened, there was still a glimmer of emancipatory potential in the passion of the event that would not have been visible otherwise.</p>
<p>If, then, Buckel has truly died in vain, we must conclude that this is not his fault, much less the fault of his enemies—but precisely those of us who, identifying ourselves with the struggle Buckel passionately cared about, have nonetheless failed to grasp, as with Kant, the emancipatory potential his admittedly grim act has shown us in its traumatic irrationality. Unfortunately, the lesson we are to learn from Buckel’s suicide is painfully clear: Buckel has not, as his critics might say, failed us by taking his life instead of staying in the struggle; but rather it was <em>us</em> who failed him by concealing the true import of his act under a caliginous cloud of ideological obfuscation masquerading as well-meaning concern for human lives. So long as this discourse by which self-negation is permanently reduced to a personal medical issue prevents genuine social activism, our society will suffer from nihilism, lack of purpose and despair—and this, I subscribe, is the true cause not only of most suicides today but indeed of antisocial crimes, too, by those who latch onto false prophets and pseudo-events for salvation. The answer to this conundrum is a true paradox in every sense of the term: to prevent suicides, we shall have to glorify suicide; and to open a truly humanist dimension of being we must indulge in the sort of anti-humanism our society habitually frowns upon. Again, if we are not willing to learn this lesson from Buckel’s death, then it seems that we never deserved to count him as our champion in the first place.</p>
