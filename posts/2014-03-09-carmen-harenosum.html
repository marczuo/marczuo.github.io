<p>Sea of gold, blindingly glistering and gleaming,<br />
Beneath the relentless blazes of the sun<br />
The realm of nourishing mother peace unfurls<br />
Over the bleak, bare and barren wilderness.</p>
<p>Tranquility—panacea of the soul.<br />
Here lie the olden gods, here lie fallen men.<br />
Forgotten alike by the world, they are sleeping<br />
One eternal somber, soundless and solemn.</p>
<p>Pillarless, roofless, the very land beneath<br />
Stood, temple invisible, eternally<br />
Tended by the sun, by the wind, by the earth,<br />
A hall without walls, prayers without a priest.</p>
<p>Land of the Garamants? Perhaps the Augyls?<br />
It matters not; mere mortals these sacred grounds.<br />
Shall not claim. In this divine abode walked gods.<br />
Their strides turned into gold, treasures of mankind.</p>
<p>Once they did—long, long ago, a golden age<br />
Saw them reigning over these lands. In those days<br />
The earth was fertile and rivers flowed freely.<br />
Trees, flowers grew here, jubilant, full of vigour.</p>
<p>So, they say, was the desert born; forbidden<br />
To mortals, yet holding such allure meanwhile<br />
That they have fought here, with iron and with blood,<br />
Ruinous wars; death polluted these very grounds.</p>
<p>Shrines looted, marble torn off, brazen mankind<br />
Earned the immortal furor of the gods.<br />
Gold they turned into worthless sand, the very land<br />
Turned sterile, Shining marble changed into soot.</p>
<p>Such wrath men had wrought—even their rotten corpses<br />
Were covered over and over by sand dunes.<br />
Divine fury knew no bounds. At last these lands<br />
Became one with death, harsh and unforgiving.</p>
<p>Flowers withered, rivers dried up, raging storms<br />
scattered all into the heavens. No sign, no trace<br />
Left of the lofty splendor that once stood here.<br />
A golden hue remained, but all else was gone.</p>
<p>So the gods have done, but their own abode too<br />
They have destroyed; and with a long, heavy sigh<br />
They closed shut, one by one, their all-seeing eyes.<br />
Immortal gods knew not death; they slept in peace.</p>
<p>But one—one alone looked over the desert,<br />
The deathly land they had formed; It was Beauty,<br />
Goddess supreme, who wept, a singular tear<br />
For the divine splendor that was gone forever.</p>
<p>And lo—her tear touched the sand, from which at once<br />
Trees sprouted out, lake filled with precious ichor.<br />
An oasis, jubilant and triumphant,<br />
The final gift she gave to a weary world.</p>
<p>And so have men, ever dreaming of divinity,<br />
Sought, to no avail, the golden oasis.<br />
Generations have come, generations buried<br />
Underneath, along their warlike ancestors.</p>
<p>Yet do they know the price of that which they seek?<br />
Immortal life condemned to this hellish land,<br />
Their thoughts their own worst prison—Infinity<br />
Without purpose, their being is nothingness.</p>
<p>The gods sleep below, soundly; so too will men.<br />
Come now, wayfarer; why run after the gods<br />
When so much still remains, the joy of living;<br />
Turn back, turn back! Beyond here lies only death.</p>
<p>Leave this cursed place; leave this golden temple<br />
To the gods who fashioned it! We must live on.<br />
And when at last the breath of life should fail us,<br />
May we then find peace, under this sea of gold.</p>
