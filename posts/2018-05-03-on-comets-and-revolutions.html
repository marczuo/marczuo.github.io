<p>A strange encounter in a basement lab. A comet. An intelligent species evolved out of a species of fish which the spectator turns out (unbeknownst to ourselves initially) to belong to within the story frame. Peter Sinn Nachtrieb’s 2008 play <em>Boom</em> could at first blush seem to have leaped straight out of the anxieties and preoccupations of the Western liberal imagination: one would talk about its deeper meaning in familiar terms like hope and optimism in the face of immense destruction and catastrophe, the possibility of happiness in a cosmically indifferent world—in short, an exemplary work of contemporary humanism that seeks to soothe the anguished liberal psyche of today, much like Ralph Fiennes’s smooth-talking concierge in the film <em>Grand Budapest Hotel</em>, that no, the world hasn’t—will not have—despite all evidence to the contrary—left them stranded in a nostalgic vision of yesteryear, their cherished values at last uprooted by the inexorable march of global capitalism and its deterritorializing prowess. There is not a little hint of an unpleasant self-aggrandizing aftertaste when the ostensible theme of “life finds a way” finds itself transposed onto artistic creation, when the unexpectedly triumphant ending of the play-within-a-play motivates Barbara, the curator of this theatrical “museum” in the framing story, to rebel against an uncaring management and to blaze her own trail of artistic expression (“art, too, finds a way”): surely as crass and unimaginative, in a distinctly bourgeois manner, a parallel as one could possibly marshal at one’s power. A cynic would have evaluated the enthusiastic reception of <em>Boom</em> amongst the theatre-going cultural elite as a kind of spiritual Zoloft effect; it is much akin to a high-culture version of kitschy Hollywood feel-good flicks these same cultural elite gleefully mock their less tasteful country-folk for flocking towards: “a tale, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.”</p>
<p>Yet it is not my intention here merely to critique the left-liberal message of this surface reading of the play; to do so would be to do the text a grave injustice and to commit a profound act of intellectual laziness. No, it is rather my goal to offer a kind of radical left appropriation of the play, a drawing out of connections—consciously or unconsciously made—to a revolutionary as opposed to evolutionary understanding of society, in which we may rescue the text from the charge of uncritical romanticism. And, far from looking at the play through the unique territoriality of New York theatre culture, I shall re-situate it in the context of modern Chinese history; since, I believe, it is here that one can discover fascinating and unexpected parallels, between two worlds far apart in culture and political orientation and yet strangely entangled by the “spooky action at a distance” of modern-day capitalism, where we may subject the play to a certain <em>rite de passage</em> in order for a far more nuanced and intellectually audacious reading to shine out. And where best to begin our quest than to look at China’s own “boom” event of the 20th century, an apocalyptic moment in time when society broke down in a cacophony of destructive revelry that shook the country to its core, leaving scars visible even today? I speak, of course, of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that lasted from the sixties to the seventies, which came at the heels of a series of international events that brought apocalypse to the forefront of the entire world’s collective imagination: the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, the Sino-Soviet split and the border standoff that would culminate in a small-scale conflict in 1969… In relation to the play, however, we shall be most interested in a certain interview given by Mao Zedong in August 1964, on the threshold of the restive Cultural Revolution years, in which he gave this fascinating assessment of the future of life on Earth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the future, animals will continue to develop. I don’t believe that men alone are capable of having two hands. Can’t horses, cows, sheep evolve? Can only monkeys evolve? And can it be, moreover, that of all the monkeys only one species can evolve, and all the others are incapable of evolving? In a million years, ten million years, will horses, cows and sheep still be the same as those today? I think they will continue to change. Horses, cows, sheep, and insects will all change. Animals have evolved from plants, they have evolved from seaweed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, is the logic of this strange echo of Darwinism not exactly what is invoked in <em>Boom</em>? Horses, cows, sheep and insects will all change—so, too, one has to presume, will fish. Now this, alone, would be a circumstantial similarity: a simple adherence to the theory of evolution can hardly suffice to show a deeper affinity between Mao Zedong’s thought and Nachtrieb’s play. Yet further down Mao elaborates,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mankind will also finally meet its doom. When the theologians talk about doomsday, they are pessimistic and terrify people. We say the end of mankind is something which will produce something more advanced than mankind. Mankind is still in its infancy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Optimism about doomsday—how eerily does Nachtrieb’s play find itself bedfellows with the instigator of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, as far away from typical Western left-liberal values as one can possibly go! But there is something extremely dissonant in Mao’s ruminations on the global extinction of mankind as opposed to the humanist reading of <em>Boom</em>; whereas <em>Boom</em> seems almost to underscore how similar this post-apocalyptic society “millions and millions of years” removed from our (real) modern society by surreptitiously placing the audience in the role of members of the post-apocalyptic society, thus implicitly endorsing the assumption that the “new mankind” shares the same subjectivity as the “old mankind” (us, in real life), Mao is quite plainly drawing on the Nietzschean tradition of the Übermensch—“something more advanced than mankind,” in his words. The assertion of this revolutionarily new mankind (as opposed to the evolutionarily new mankind of our previous reading of <em>Boom</em>) is taken almost as an ethical imperative: “when you discover a law, you must be able to apply it, you must create the world anew, you must break the ground and edify buildings, you must dig mines, industrialize.” It may, then, seem that there is after all something irreconciliable between <em>Boom</em>’s vision of repetition and Mao Zedong’s faith in progress; indeed, one would be fundamentally mistaken to call <em>Boom</em> a purely Maoist play. Its resonance with Chinese history can only be uncovered on a different dimension, one that takes into consideration developments under Deng Xiaoping and his successors.</p>
<p>Let us review the basic structure of <em>Boom</em> at this point before moving on with our analysis. A graduate student in marine biology, Jules, publishes an ad for a sexual partner; the ad is answered by Jo, a journalism major, who goes to his basement lab only for Jules to reveal to her that he has learned about an impending worldwide extinction event through the unlikely medium of fish behavior. Ignored by his superiors, Jules resolves to keep Jo in his lab, safe from the extinction event, and to “rebuild society” with her. A horrified and disbelieving Jo tries to leave but finds herself passing out with every attempt, until a comet really does strike and she faces the prospect of having to put up with Jules and his persistent attempt to impregnate her. Along the way, we are told by a third character, Barbara, that Jules and Jo are but part of a theatrical exhibition showing “the origin of our species”; Barbara is chastised by museum management for clinging onto an outdated show which people no longer find convincing, but nevertheless tries her best to inject passion into the exhibit by occasionally interrupting and telling personal stories. The conflict between Jules and Jo reaches a climax when she, at his goading, tries to suffocate herself; Barbara, who is revealed to be controlling Jo’s passing-out to protect her, is momentarily distracted and Jo seemingly dies. Barbara and Jules eventually succeed in reviving Jo, and the two share an emotional bonding moment before deciding to take a leap into the unknown and leave the lab. We are finally told that Jules and Jo die in a flood, and the fish Jules keeps in his lab eventually evolve into a new intelligent species that is putting on this exhibition. Barbara, fired from her job, decides to open her own museum in order to keep this version of the story alive.</p>
<p>Now, if the “play-within-a-play” of the story of Jules and Jo have, as our analysis above shows, an uncanny connection to Mao’s 1964 ruminations on doomsday and a new mankind, it ought to be the segment that takes place in the “present day” relative to the play’s setting, namely in the world of the “new mankind”, that should interest us most in its parallels with Chinese society post-Deng. Don’t we, that is to say, live precisely in a kind of “millions and millions years after” with respect to Mao’s years? Ironically, of course, Mao would not have predicted that the new Chinese nation born out of the apocalyptic-themed unrests of his final years would be, in many ways, the world’s pre-eminent capitalist society, a world so far removed from Mao’s China that the Chairman’s thoughts on the next evolutionary step of mankind cannot but appear as quaint as Jules’s desperate attempt to secure a future for mankind, utterly sublimated, as it turns out, by what is seemingly entirely barred from consideration as a possible agent of history: the fish in <em>Boom</em>, capitalist subjectivity in Maoism. It is as if, by ostensibly echoing Mao’s predictions of non-sentient species rising in the vacuum left by mankind, <em>Boom</em> plays an ultimate joke on the fact that Maoism itself left a vacuum at the end of the Cultural Revolution that capitalist ideology rushed to fill.</p>
<p>Viewed from this perspective, there is a case to be made that the ideal audience of <em>Boom</em> consists precisely of contemporary Chinese people fully immersed in the “post-apocalyptic” world of Deng Xiaoping-style capitalism, for whom it is not exactly theatrical art <em>in toto</em>, but a narrower impression of the revolutionary past under Mao that Barbara clings onto that ought to have struck us (as the “museum management” Barbara rails against rightly points out) as being more than a little antiquated. Ours is the world that insists on profits and efficiency over human interests, where the ideological logic of cold numbers reigns supreme over the subjective logic of desire. This is precisely the context in which a younger generation of admirers of Mao finds themselves fantasizing over the lost emancipatory potential of the first thirty years of the People’s Republic of China, a vision which clashes with the Deng generation horrified by the actual excesses of that period; but, rather than simply dismissing the neo-Maoists for harboring an unrealistic, romanticized notion of Mao’s rule, what must be done today is a kind of Hegelian “negation of the negation” that sublimates again the Maoist–anti-Maoist contradiction into a more complex recognition of the larger historical flow which necessarily passes through a Mao-phase, a Deng-phase towards a future <em>Aufhebung</em> which re-appropriates the emancipatory potential of Maoism, which at a certain step in the development of social relations of production concretizes into actual, workable plans for a new act of revolutionary significance, which might set out in the ideological space opened up by the Badiouan event of the collective struggle of the Chinese people a true path towards the concrete realization of communism.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is my argument that fantasy of the kind which theatrical art is traditionally meant to provide, the kind which Nachtrieb deftly throws into relief in Barbara’s monologue about the credibility of the Jules-Jo “story in the story”, is, far from a means of ideological control through false consciousness, as the surface reading of the play might indicate, in fact the ideal coordinate system within which this larger ideological project might be realized. One can often hear about the supposedly “Maoist” turn taken by the Chinese leadership in the past five years as it is helmed by Xi Jinping, who has drawn inspiration from Maoist methods in order to assert authoritative power at the expense of the Deng Xiaoping-style collective leadership. No doubt this political re-orientation at the highest echelons of Zhongnanhai (the seat of government in Beijing) reflects a growing awareness at the top of and willingness to exploit the country’s alienation by the forces of capitalism and a natural response to its deterritorializing instincts by demanding authoritarian methods of reterritorialization at the hands of the government; nonetheless, there is a crucial distinction to be made between “Xi-ism” and Mao’s ideological theory even at the time of the start of the Cultural Revolution, which largely had a political purpose for Mao to seize back supreme power from the bureaucrats who sidelined him after the disasters of the early 1960s. Namely, one must realize that Xi-ism, under its surface allegiance to the legacy of Mao, has a profoundly reactionary ideological core which focuses on the naked nihilist maintenance of power: Xi-ism is far more germane to the ideology of, say, Vladimir Putin than that of the old Soviet regime. If Xi Jinping can provide any inspiration to today’s radical thinkers disaffected by the ills of an ideologically unchallenged global capitalism, it is by demonstrating the continued relevance of Maoism much more than actually resurrecting old Maoist ideas. <em>We must reject Xi Jinping not because he has brought back the dead ghost of Maoism but precisely because he is not Maoist enough.</em> If we want to go beyond the formal Maoism of Xi Jinping and speak of an actual Maoism, one that is more faithful to Mao Zedong’s intentions than to his methods, we ought to go one step beyond and reclaim not just the pragmatic dimensions of Maoism (“Mao Zedong kept the communist regime intact!”) and speak in a register of symbolic fantasy, to reclaim the more utopian aspirations of Mao’s brand of Marxism-Leninism, not only to repress but to impress. And we may find inspiration from precisely the most traumatic and chaotic period of Mao Zedong’s rule, a time of actual horrors and disastrous consequences for the entire nation, of which merely mentioning the name can make many shudder: I am, of course, once again talking about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.</p>
<p>Few people at the apex of Mao Zedong’s regime inspire as much fascination and horror in both the Western and the Chinese imagination as Mao’s wife, Jiang Qing, or “Madame Mao” as she is frequently known to an English-speaking audience. Yet few remember that Jiang Qing, before she met Mao and was fully immersed in his revolutionary fight in Yan’an, was an actor by occupation. Which, of course, explains her preoccupation with theatre during the Cultural Revolution which she spearheaded along with the infamous “Gang of Four”: being a thespian herself, she knew just how much fantasy is, even more than the pragmatic humdrum of everyday struggle, a core component of every revolutionary project that aspires to genuine social change. In this vein, Jiang Qing sponsored the production of a small handful of “revolutionary model operas” that were performed across the nation from the most sumptuous opera houses in Beijing to radio recordings played back in the poorest peasant villages. What I mean to say is not that we ought to bring back these model operas themselves as a kind of re-affirmation of the Maoist political project, just as I do not advocate bringing back such policies as the Great Leap Forward; yet we must, without losing sight on the ways in which society has genuinely progressed in the last forty years or so, create our very own revolutionary fantasy as the basis on which to understand the foresight of the Maoist revolution and to pave the way for the next step after capitalism’s implosion under its own internal contradictions, which already today reminds us daily of its impotence under a façade of dominant fatalist “no-alternative” Thatcherism much like a dream in which the traumatic kernel of the Real keeps manifesting itself where it is least wanted (like, one might even say, a badly produced theatre play where the actors keep forgetting their lines and exposing the unwanted Real of the theatrical production). For fantasy, we must remember this Lacanian lesson, is not a supervening structure that obfuscates a wholesome objective reality or appropriates it for its own purposes, but the very sense-horizon in which reality manifests itself as such. Fantasy, in short, is more real than reality. This is the lesson which the predominant ideology of a society—capitalism, that is, for us—always tries to conveniently sweep under the rug, and we, too, risk diluting the emancipatory insight of contemporary Marxism (as it has been developed by, among others, Althusser’s analysis of ideology) if we wish to attain a revolutionary society without this key insight that makes revolution as such possible.</p>
<p>The most genuine failure of revolutionary communism lies not in its rejection and repudiation—for even the very fact of being the object of repudiation has a power all to its own, as many revolutionaries over the course of history have realized—but in its decontextualized appropriation by capitalism itself, the absorption of its ideas outside the fantasy-horizon of revolutionary communism itself, which is ideologically barred to the modern thinker even as its actual content have become more accessible than ever. Today’s Wall Street financiers pride themselves in being avid readers of Karl Marx without daring to embrace Marxism as such—“oh yes, the man has some really fascinating ideas, but nevertheless…” If the subject of the capitalist world who “talks the talk of capitalism but dreams the dream of communism” forms the backbone of revolutions, today’s subject of the “post-capitalist” world who “talks the talk of communism but dreams the dream of capitalism” locks herself even more tightly in the strange-hold of capitalism (is this not the very strategy that leaders of China from Deng to Xi have embraced to various degrees?), so that our job today consists more than ever in resurrecting this fantasy-horizon of Marxism, in enabling the dreaming of a new communist dream that, far from regressing to the worst excesses of Maoism as such, opens up new possibilities of revolutionary thinking and enables resistance to the creeping-in of nihilist ideologies like Putinism, Xi-ism, Trumpism and all manners of worshippers at the altar of naked power.</p>
<p>To go back to the play <em>Boom</em>, are not Barbara’s self-avowedly unreliable (“I’ve embellished, of course, as we are wont to do—but I remain faithful to the story’s intent”) stories and narratives not precisely what is necessary today contrary to the instincts of those who resist the “subjectivization” of history? Isn’t it today’s revolutionary subject’s very job to embellish the history of Maoism as long as we remain faithful to Mao Zedong’s intent? Of course, such a radical proposal is bound to attract criticisms that we seek to rewrite history in a manner that conjures up the worst images of Stalinist and Maoist terror, the kind of courtship with dishonest manipulation of the masses that will necessarily end in dictatorship and oppression. True, if we are to understand this proposal in terms of actually rewriting history books, launching propaganda campaigns and applying all the old totalitarian means of social control, then we will have totally missed the more nuanced ideas lying underneath this surface-level understanding; revolutionary fantasy is surely not the same as revolutionary propaganda.</p>
<p>But what, exactly, is the subtle difference I am trying to draw out here? How exactly does theatre above all lend itself to the construction of revolutionary fantasy as opposed to propaganda? Theatre, we must remember, always plays on a gap on two different levels to draw its signifying power: on stage, what is <em>really</em> going on is a make-believe: we, as members of the audience, know the actors are not the characters, and we know their Real content is separated from their Symbolic role merely by the fact of being in the structural context of theatre: this is the operation of symbolic castration at its purest. What ideology is, is merely an obfuscated version of theatre: one acts and one does not notice this. Marx’s greatest insight in economy is his idea of the “commodity fetish”: we know that, for instance, in a capitalist society the relations of production is real and money is merely symbolic, but we act as if we do not know this and treat money as having inherent, objective value. What distinguishes theatre here, then, is the presence of spectators: observed, we suddenly understand the gap of symbolic castration and perceive this lack as the cause of desire. Yet the uniqueness of theatre is that this desire is not, as in everyday ideological society, treated as an aberration from normalcy to be eliminated: theatre is the art of the pervert who does not hide away from and reject the presence of the symbolic gap and the intrusion of the real, but delights in it as the very productive source of her art, an art which relies above all on the mechanism of disavowal rather than repression: “yes, I know I am not Jules, or Jo, or Barbara, but I nevertheless act as if I were.” Is not, then, the true revolutionary the actor and the actor the true revolutionary? Our revolutionary fantasy is sharply distinguished from propaganda by the same distinction Lacan draws between the neurotic psyche, which he held as normal, and the pervert psyche that threatens the institution of repression through its very disregard. Propaganda has as its key enabling condition neurotic repression and self-repression, whereas revolutionary fantasy in its true pervert-schizophrenic dimension candidly acknowledges its own symbolic gap but treats this negative lack as a positive condition of desire, an embracing of desire-flux without, like the neurotic, calling for its reterritorialization under the totalizing state apparatuses of Stalinism and the “bad, old” sort of Maoism which we mean to repeat in a liberating way that is free from the intrusion of the neurotic subject which, as Deleuze and Guattari might say, demands totality out of the chaos of rhizomatic desiring-production and in the process distort the emancipatory potential of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism into its grotesque pragmatic realization that represses far more than it liberates.</p>
<p>It is also for this reason that we must reject Jiang Qing’s realization of her theatrical projects even as we affirm that her orientation towards the theatre itself is, for the reason we discussed above, the right move to take. What is lacking in her revolutionary model operas is precisely also this willingness to perversion, since they fall prey to the same neurotic totalizing tendency which denies them the true status of revolutionary fantasy and makes them merely specimens of political propaganda; and, when we say that they lack a willingness to perversion, we mean precisely that they rely on the same hiding-oneself-away from the symbolic gap, that they fail to consider that it is in this very gap that all revolutions nourish the fantasy that enables the concrete realization of their goals. The precise mistake of Jiang Qing, and by extension the entire repertoire of “socialist realist” theatre and cinema going back to the earliest days of the Stalinist Soviet Union, lies in its emphasis of content over form, since it is in the theatrical <em>form</em> that the revolutionary subject’s truth can be found. It is the <em>medium</em> of theatre, as Marshall McLuhan would say, in which its mechanisms of desiring-production operate through the schizophrenic foregrounding of symbolic castration, that is eclipsed in model plays by the inherently inane content that serves merely as a kind of school examination on how well we have internalized the neurotic-repressive ideological state apparatuses in a way not too different from the kind of kitsch art that proliferates in uncritical capitalist society. Going back to the play <em>Boom</em>, I consider the character of Barbara in all her perversion to be a perfect counterpoint to the neurosis of Jiang Qing and her model plays, the true Maoist revolutionary who can rise to the height of the construction of a revolutionary fantasy; contrary to admonishings from her superiors, Barbara insists on disturbing the neurotic-repressive separation between her role as the personification of the theatrical form and the content that is the “play within the play” of the Jules-Jo story by leaping into action, interrupting it with her long monologues in which she acknowledges that she is “not really supposed to be speaking” (supposed, that is, by the neurosis of the Oedipal subject). Is not, then, the ending where Jules and Jo’s long and agonizing conflict turns out to have no consequence whatsoever as they die an ultimately meaningless death not a great triumph of form over content, of revolutionary fantasy over revolutionary reality? Far from expressing some unconditioned humanist optimism, then, as the surface reading of the play might indicate, we should understand the real optimism of <em>Boom</em> to consist in this triumphant affirmation of fantasy and the horizon of desiring-production free from neurotic repression.</p>
<p>The revolution is a theatre in every sense, and it is at its most effective only when this significance is truly understood. When we find ourselves today facing the historical task of transcending the ideological degeneration of global capitalism and completing the sublimation of its internal contradictions, we are, both as historical observers and historical agents, truly tasked with a desiring-production whose end product is a fantasy which is both prospective and retrospective. We see, then, that beyond a single negation of Maoism that the future race descended from the fish is supposed to symbolize—the Deng generation that embraces the logic of global capitalism—there lurks in fact an as-yet unrealized possibility of a dialectic negation of the negation, a resuscitation of the revolutionary fantasy along an entirely new axis of liberation: like Barbara’s little assemblage of desiring-machines, this new revolutionary fantasy will allow us to approach the past as well as the future in a radically different light: just as the apocalypse as seen from the perspective of Jules and Jo is radically different from the apocalypse seen by Jonjohn and Dorothy (and by the race that descended from them, of course), so, too, will the very discursive dimension of this new revolutionary fantasy open up the possibility of freedoms which we can hardly imagine from our ideologically-limited perspective. There’s little wonder, then, that the final monologue of the play in which Barbara announces the opening of her very own museum contains an obvious (though maybe unintentional) echo of Badiou, incidentally a committed Maoist to the very end: we will, indeed, stay tuned for “Barbara’s Museum of Epic and Intimate <em>Events</em>”, where the word “event” should be understood in all its revolutionary import as the unconcealing of discursive horizon which a movement such as Mao Zedong’s communist revolution opens up and which a future fantasy is required for us to understand it in its full symbolic significance. For it is, of course, only then that the apocalyptic consequences of Maoism can be fully reinscribed in a dialectic movement of history which will, hopefully in less time than 65 million years, open up the next step towards liberation and the unyoking of desire from the tyranny of neurotic repression.</p>
