<p>On the 14th of February, a man took a rifle to a high school in Parkland, Florida and shot seventeen people dead. This is what happened; these facts are not in doubt. Fascinating, then, is the reaction of various political factions in its aftermath. Or, perhaps I should say, not fascinating at all, but rather quotidian by now, as we have gotten used not only to mass shootings in America but also to the polarized reaction to them, a reminder that, however much the facts remain the same for partisans of either political wing, the worlds they inhabit are clearly separate and disjoint. These are the familiar reactions, which any American scarcely needs to be reminded of: a faction mostly associated with the Democratic Party, again, spoke out in emotional terms pleading for gun control—if not the total abolition of the right to bear arms, then at least actual, effective regulation of them, in contrast to the current state of affairs; then there is a faction allied with the conservative movement and the NRA, which specializes in producing arguments and narratives purporting to show that, far from needing to restrict the ownership of firearms, we need to turn even more people into gun owners: if, for instance, they argue, we mandate that all schoolteachers arm themselves, would it not solve the problem of mass shootings? The image they project is the fantasy of the ultra-libertarian Eden of self-reliant gun owners, invariably morally unblemished and always standing ready to do the right thing; such is the goal, they argue, and not the gun-free society of the pro-gun control wing, that such shootings as the Parkland tragedy should motivate us to work towards.</p>
<p>My purpose in writing this essay is not the evaluation of either side’s arguments. Indeed to do so, which in any case pundits and ordinary folks alike have done <em>ad nauseam</em>, is an exercise in futility on the same order as the proverbial struggles of Sisyphus: who can we possibly aim to convince, when the acceptance of either of these competing narratives is far from an act of reason for most of their adherents, and more of an act of faith? But it is in fact possible for us to notice a central contradiction here present, not in the arguments proffered, but rather in a certain way in the unconscious of both sides, which of course is not to say that they are <em>wrong</em>, or that neither side can claim to be better than the other (a sophistic falsehood which certain members of the news media, under the pretense of maintaining their neutrality, are fond of perpetuating), but rather that there is something more than meets the eye here, something which calls not for an analyst of rationality but for one of irrationality, which nevertheless, we hope, might produce insights into what motivates the current deadlocked partisan polarization, which, as experience has amply shown, a mere rational comparison of the actual arguments themselves does not suffice in defusing but only to reinforce.</p>
<p>This contradiction I speak of, of course, is the discrepancy between the stated positions of the liberal and the conservative wings as opposed to what one might predict based on those attributes of them that one might reasonably deem essential. On the one hand, isn’t there something remarkable that the conservative wing, which is in many ways so intricately linked to the Evangelical Christian movement, is also the side that militates for expanded gun rights? After all, a gun is in its essential truth an instrument for killing, and is in fact useful for precisely nothing else (unlike, say, explosives, which are useful for excavation, or poison which is useful in certain cases for therapeutic purposes). And are the Ten Commandments not the very most cherished and revered precepts of the Christian religion? Indeed, was it not by claiming to be taking a stand for those same Ten Commandments, supposedly under the assault of secular liberals, that Roy Moore earned himself a removal from the Alabaman Supreme Court and the undying adoration of much of the American right? But then, do not the Ten Commandments emphatically and unambiguously say, “thou shalt not kill”? Now it is true, we must admit, that most Christians have not interpreted this commandment as an absolute injunction against killing (killing in self-defense, for instance, is rarely considered a transgression). But this does not change the transgressive nature of the conservatives’ demand to expand gun rights; even if, on a conscious, rational level their demand, namely to possess guns for lawful, moral ends is not in itself contradictory to their commitment to the Ten Commandments, one may nevertheless be justified in suspecting that there is something more in play here. To use an analogy, one may be perfectly justified to note that some drug with potentials for abuse, say morphine, nevertheless has legitimate medical uses, and on these grounds argue for its widespread familiarity; but we nevertheless do not take this argument at face value, and say to ourselves “huh, I guess it’s true that in some cases carrying morphine on you at all times can prove life-saving”. Rather, is it not precisely a bit of analysis of the underlying motivation we engage in when we give the much more probable response, namely “what exactly are you pushing this argument for, if not so that you will have the opportunity to abuse it”? In the same way, when we take a peek underneath the rationally self-consistent arguments of the pro-gun, religious right wing, do we not invariably find this desire, conscious or unconscious, to transgress the very Ten Commandments which in other contexts they would claim to exalt? “Thou shalt not kill, but thou shalt always carry that one object which functions solely to enable you to kill”—such is the underlying desire of the right wing, a desire that is hopelessly contradictory and absurd in its very statement.</p>
<p>But then do we not find a similar contradiction—again, not in the rational arguments but in the psyche of those who proffer them—in those who argue for gun control? For we are wont to find the secular liberal who affirms humanist and progressive values in this group, but why? Indeed this contradiction operates on multiple levels; first of all, liberal values, we might say, are grounded in an essential permissive attitude to human affairs and a commitment to a certain (qualified) hedonistic position such as that famous right to the “pursuit of happiness” identified in the American Declaration of Independence. But how is one to reconcile this permissiveness and the paradoxically puritanical position the secular liberal takes in relation to gun ownership? To put in other words, the secular liberal says “enjoy yourself” and simultaneously “repress yourself if you ever desire to possess a firearm”. This is the flip side of the pro-gun, religious right: the permissive, pro-gun control left. On a different dimension, is it not paradoxical that the liberal progressive claims to be committed to empowering the weak, yet deny them that ultimate instrument of power: the instrument to kill, that is to say firearms? Where Marx agitated for the immediate arming of all workers in view of effecting the proletarian revolution, today’s progressive left seems almost to fear that logical conclusion of the left-wing narrative which Marx embraced with no qualms whatsoever. “We want to liberate the weak from oppression,” they seem to say, “while we can’t even trust in them to not immediately kill themselves off in a violent bloodbath if given the power to do so and left to their own devices.” Clearly, we cannot take the arguments of the pro-gun control left wholly at their face value either, if we are to achieve a deeper understanding of the American psyche which has so far frustrated all attempts at reconciliation.</p>
<p>We may, I believe, understand the reasons for these tensions if we remind ourselves that firearms in the gun control debate, as gun culture in America in general proves, are not simply pure instrumentality in itself—the instrument, in this case, to kill, but rather symbolic for something else. Recall the pro-gun fantasy mentioned in the very beginning of this essay, the Eden of moral rectitude made secure against the intrusions of the stranger, who doesn’t share my values and consequently can’t be trusted to act within the recognizable bounds that make up the bulwark of my safety. Are not the pro-gun right constantly referring back to this same fantasy when they justify their bearing of firearms to themselves? This phantasmatic social organization, a relation that is supposed to exist between people in the pro-gun fantasy, is precisely the reason why the pro-gun right believe in guns even in the absence of any real, practical need for them. In Freudian terms, what properly speaking is a state of affairs existing between people is displaced onto the object which is erroneously thought to bear the power to create that state of affairs by itself; the pro-gun right practices, in fact, a sort of fetishism of guns. I will elaborate: are guns really that which brings safety to the pro-gun fantasy? No; it is the fact that the other is excluded in his unknowability, a fact which pertains to subjects and not to objects, which brings us safety in the fantasy. The pro-gun right, in short, perceives the relations between people, as Marx would say, in the relations between objects, namely guns, in the state of being born on individuals. It is in this sense that the pro-gun right has a gun fetish. Yet underlying this fantasy which reveals the fetishism, is there not something even more uncanny at work? For the moral rectitude that characterizes us <em>qua</em> us in the pro-gun fantasy is the ultimate fiction that renders the fantasy untenable. As any good novelist knows, you never write a character who is unceasingly good to the extent that we are given not even the chance to doubt her goodness; such a character is pejoratively dubbed “Mary Sue” and is taken as a sign of the author’s incompetence. Good characters, of course, are not <em>verboten</em> in a good story; but the reader should, at least from time to time, be held in suspense as we wonder to ourselves if her ostensible goodness isn’t hiding something sinister; it may eventually turn out that there really is no mask, that she is in fact as good as she led us to believe, but it is that process of questioning that establish her as an authentic other, that permits us to suspend our disbelief and our tendency to see her as what she really is, a figment of the author’s imagination whom we will never encounter in real life.</p>
<p>In just the same way, the pro-gun fantasy, upon closer inspection, sheds its wholesome communal image like the proverbial wolf in sheep’s skin and reveals a bloody underside. The fantasy is subverted when one realizes that the fetishization of firearms itself reveals that what we have called the “us”, the knowable subjects of the world who are united to me in my quest to oppose the other, is in fact none other but me in my solitude. Everyone, even my neighbor, and perhaps especially my neighbor, is to me, when all is said and done, when all the layers of the Lacanian symbolic fiction are peeled away, unknowable, radically other, so that in the end the congenial, communal image of the pro-gun fantasy gives way to a bleak reality of me against the world, against all others. This is why the potent locus of the fantasy has to be evicted from the Imaginary of intersubject relations to the Symbolic of the gun as signifier; the fetishization of firearms is a kind of mediation through the big Other that sustains the fantasy in the traumatic discovery of the radical alterity of the others. Notice, also, that the genesis of the fantasy must be traced back to the Christianity of the pro-gun right itself; “love thy neighbor”, commands the Bible; thus the seed for the communal fantasy is planted within us. But what is there to love? The radical other that is my neighbor, with whom I strive to identify myself but am constantly thwarted by his alterity? For indeed, when we desire to love, says the personage of Aristophanes in Plato’s Symposium, what is it that we desire other than to be united to the one we love, to be made one and the same? So to love one’s neighbor is properly speaking <em>a priori</em> paradoxical, akin to saying “be one with that with which you cannot be one!” Much easier is to externalize that impossible love, which Christianity <em>qua</em> the big Other in its function as the superego, constantly demanding the impossible of me to realize its control over me via my guilt, has commanded me to show my neighbor, in an object of sheer, brutal, murderous power such as a gun. “If I cannot love my neighbor, at least I can kill him.” This formulation, as much as it is the logic of the obsessive stalker, is also that of the gun fetishist, who, faced with his inherent vulnerability in front of the others which he seeks to remedy with gun ownership and the simultaneous demand of the big Other to love his neighbor, paradoxically displaces that love to the gun itself, symbolically substituting a power it does not possess, namely to reconcile him to the other, for one that it does, namely to shoot and kill the other who threatens him so. Of course, the gun fetishist does not consciously believe that having the power to kill will magically reconcile him to the other and satisfy the demand of the big Other; nevertheless, as Freud noted, his knowledge in no way lessens the hold his fetish has over him, and it is this subconsciously-held contradiction that pushes him to come up with rational justifications for his fetish. It is for this reason that attacking these rational justifications does precisely nothing to dissuade the gun fetishist from his fetish; it would be like trying to talk a foot fetishist out of his foot fetish by noting that the foot, after all, is not a sexual organ. As Octave Mannoni puts it, “<em>je sais bien, mais quand même.</em>” The game of persuading a fetishist on a rational level is failed before it even begins.</p>
<p>Thus we may explain the contradiction previously noted between the religious right’s pro-gun position and its commitment to the Ten Commandments that prohibit killing. In fact, for the gun fetishist, the gun is no longer really an instrument for killing: it symbolically carries the displaced injunction to “love thy neighbor”; it is the fetishistic object that allows us to sustain our Eden fantasy through the mediation of the big Other. The one who kills, in the Symbolic eventuality where he has to kill (which need not be actualized in reality), is no longer him in a way, but rather the big Other. This does not imply some conscious justification of a (potential) killing by appealing to the big Other, but to the contrary is a pure exercise of the unconscious in its symbolic structure, where the guilt that the big Other <em>qua</em> superego foists on me is returned to sender, and the transgression of the injunction against killing is pardoned insofar as, for the gun fetishist, this transgression is relocated to the big Other itself and thus becomes a non-transgression; this is the logic of the unconscious that subverts the typical religious fear, as articulated by Dostoyevsky, that “if there is no God, then everything is permitted”. Rather, as Žižek points out in contrast, “if there <em>is</em> a God, then everything is permitted” through mediation in Him in the role of the big Other. But in fact the fetishistic logic doesn’t only condone the drive to kill; it promotes it in the same way an obsessive stalker makes the paradoxical leap from loving someone to harming, even killing her. Žižek again provides the key to resolving this paradox: we tend to think of the delusional religious fundamentalist, say the radical Islamist, as believing too much—“normal” religious people are content to take scripture symbolically while the fundamentalist is the one who must believe in it on a literal level. But, he says, is not the fundamentalist paradoxically similar to the secular liberal in a way, in that both seek not only to <em>believe</em>, but to <em>believe that we know</em>? Thus “normal” religious people simply believe that God exists, while the fundamentalist is motivated by the need to believe that he <em>knows</em> that God exists, that it isn’t just a contingent belief of his. How similar is this to the modern scientific attitude of the secular liberal! Only in the case of the fundamentalist this hubris to want to know, and not only believe in, that which is beyond the ability of reason to know drives him into delusion. In just the same way the obsessive stalker’s and in just the same way the obsessive pro-gun right’s wanting to be one with the other, which is a transcendental impossibility, in the former case driven by desire and in the latter case by religious command, exceeds the boundaries of Symbolic mediation and actualizes into the opposite behavior, namely harmful acts for the stalker and obsession with and the fetishization of firearms for the pro-gun right.</p>
<p>Conversely, is not the contradiction caused by the secular, liberal left’s pro-gun control position not also understandable in view of this American fetishization of firearms? Again, I do not mean to say that it is <em>wrong</em> for the secular left to call for gun control, or that they don’t have legitimate reasons to do so. What is at stake here is the unconscious tension between the liberal permissive attitude in society contrasted with a certain, almost irrational fear of and disgust at firearms which many of us who consider ourselves liberal no doubt have felt. The liberal is paradoxically placed in the role of the ascetic: his relation with firearms is the flip-side of fetishism: phobia. Still it must be cautioned that this phobia is different from the mere <em>fear</em> of being killed in an act of gun violence; that fear is perfectly rational whereas phobia is something deeper, something pathological. Many people around the world may fear gun violence, but it is only in America, only where what started off as a right to bear arms morphed into what we have analyzed as gun fetishism, that this gun phobia can take root. Indeed the Symbolic displacement represented in the phobic attitude of the liberal left is the same as that of the right’s fetishism: it concerns one’s relation with the others. What the modern liberal left has that, say, the Marxist left didn’t share in common (and the Marxist left, as we have clearly seen, has none of this peculiar liberal gun phobia) is clearly an attitude of openness; the other is not to be feared, but to be respected in his difference; thus the focus on diversity of the liberal left. Yet this demand also structures our relation to the other in a certain way, as pointed out (again) in Žižek: we respect the other’s difference, so long as it doesn’t protrude on us; thus the liberal left’s phobia of harassment. The other can only be respected insofar as he is not really other.</p>
<p>What, then, is all this analysis of the fetishization of firearms supposed to show us? The takeaway is that, perhaps somewhat surprisingly, both the pro-gun right and the pro-gun control left participate in the same fetishism that the American right to bear arms has developed into; in brief, both positions are, we might say, pathological. Once again, we must remember that simply because something is pathological does not mean it is <em>false</em>, or that it is not the right thing; for instance, recalling the drug addiction analogy from above, it is a commonplace that the drug addict will exhibit, from time to time, either drug-seeking behavior (“I need my fix right now, everything be damned”) or extreme contrition (“I swear to God, I will never do drugs ever again”). Now, it is obvious that both modes of behavior are pathological; a normal, non-addict would exhibit neither of them. But it is equally obvious that the addict really <em>would</em> benefit from never doing drugs ever again, and really <em>would</em> be harmed by giving in to drug-seeking behavior. On the level of the conscious, there is no false equality between the two modes of behavior: we should clearly argue for the former and against the latter. But, if we were to be running an addiction clinic, we would clearly not consider our job done if the addict is in the contritional mode: sooner or later, we know, the addict will simply revert to drug-seeking behavior because the underlying tension has not been resolved. The treatment is complete only when the patient is no longer an addict, in the sense that the patient no longer structures the world according to the modes of behavior prescribed by drug addiction; that, in short, like normal people, the patient can live without thinking about drugs all the time, one way or another. Is it not this same thing what we should strive for in our quest to cure America of the collective manic depression that is its gun fetishism? In fact, looking at almost any other country in the world, it would be clear as day that America has a pathological relation to guns; in no other country, that is to say, either those that have strong gun control like much of Europe and China, or those where gun violence remains an issue such as certain parts of Latin America and in failed states like Somalia—in none of these countries can we find quite the same sort of bipolar attitude towards guns as America has that is indicative of its underlying fetishism. To cure America of this ailment is not only to convince it of the need for gun control; indeed this is quite impossible without confronting the fetish head-on. This is the answer to the question that is posed after every mass shooting: why, even now, can we not come to an agreement?</p>
<p>Now, having said all that, I do not pretend that the fetishization of guns is the <em>only</em> factor in the deadlock over gun control that has so far paralyzed America; no doubt, for instance, some will point out that there is money to be made in the industry of gun manufacturing by encouraging more people to buy guns. (Yet, as a news article I read a while ago pointed out, gun sales in fact rise when people perceive gun control supporters to be ascendant and fall when the reverse is true; a fact that underlines the role of psychology in even the economic aspect of the debate over gun control and that, while some individuals may indeed be pushing pro-gun narratives for their own economic gain, the success of the pro-gun faction might in fact be despite, not due to these efforts.) What is ultimately important, though, is that there is no way out of the gun control debate conundrum when we simply participate in the debate on a rational level, by taking both sides’ arguments at face value and ignoring the deeper question of <em>why</em> they would argue for what they are arguing for.</p>
