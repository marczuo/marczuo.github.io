<p>It is that familiar moment again when journalists have to learn the jargon of yet another one of the Internet’s myriad communities as an event has catapulted them to international prominence; this time, however, the circumstances are far more sinister, the event far more unsettling: for the group in question is none other that the infamous “Incels”, a gathering of young men united by virulent misogyny and in their admiration for Elliot Rodger, the college shooter who targeted women, believing himself to be exacting revenge for the perceived injustice they have done to him. The event itself, unfortunately, is an even more ramped-up re-run of Rodger’s murder spree: the killer, Alek Minassian, took a page from the Islamic terrorist playbook and ran people down in a van, killing 10 and injuring others. The clue that sent journalists on a frantic mission to uncover more about the online Incel community: Minassian’s post praising Rodger and calling for an “Incel rebellion” published moments before the crime. Overnight, a word belonging to the darker corners of the Web became the latest focal point in the politics of society. Who are the Incels, and what exactly do they want? Panicked observers try to figure out.</p>
<p>In this case, one can easily point out the fact that mass murder by lonely, disaffected young men is nothing new. Whether by means of guns or otherwise, we’ve unfortunately been here numerous times before already, and one should of course contextualize Minassian’s latest crime in this background. Yet there is something new, something quite unseen before in his attack compared to the outbursts of young male rage that we have sadly all seen too much of: a certain, that is to say, ideological coherence—or at least semblance thereof—which Minassian, the perpetrator, could cite to justify his act. But why should we even consider the ideological justifications terrorists as a matter of definition rely upon? Some may ask. After all, we know well from experience that terrorists often have a “true” reason for committing atrocities—alienation from family, fame-seeking, et cetera; it is a certain intellectual fashion to dismiss out of hand what terrorists <em>say</em> they want for what <em>truly</em> motivates them. Thus, one might argue that the Minassian case is, after all, not substantially different from all the public shootings we have witnessed before: the only difference lies in a fiction, something immaterial, intangible, which obscures and covers up the <em>real</em> motivations, which we need to consider as opposed to superficialities in order to understand and hopefully prevent these attacks in the future.</p>
<p>Against this sort of reasoning, we must raise the question of which is more “true”, the Real of the concrete situation Minassian found himself in, the meaningless and humdrum elements of his life that pushed him to commit such a heinous crime, or the Symbolic fiction of the Incel ideology which we might hypothesize that Minassian only latched onto in order to give sense to his desires?</p>
