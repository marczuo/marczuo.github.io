<p>Of untimely disaster I sing, which first befell the race<br />
of America, proud and haughty, and which to the brink<br />
of destruction took them, nearly appointing as leader<br />
a most insolent man, who wears an orange mane about.<br />
Much, too, was the conflict stirred up in high heavens,<br />
as gods battled gods, goddesses goddesses, until at last<br />
peace was found again, and ultimate disaster averted.</p>
<p>Who was it, Muse, who at first this insolence wrought?<br />
Olympian Zeus, the Thunderer, and his son Argeiphontes;<br />
for in high Olympos the gods make their home, over<br />
and above, ceaselessly watching the affairs of mortals;<br />
but now the high heart of Zeus the Thunderer groaned<br />
and called upon the gods and goddesses to congress.<br />
And when he saw that the other gods are all present,<br />
he before all others started to speak in winged words.<br />
«Ye gods, hear of this new thing which troubles me:<br />
you know well that to all peoples of the world<br />
I render visit from time to time, testing them;<br />
and when I came to visit the American race, I found<br />
a people once known for its daring and boldness<br />
now descended into timidity, and fear, and suspicion,<br />
as an eagle, weighed down with the scar of its age,<br />
who in former days would lord over the mountains,<br />
chasing after its prey with arrow-like speed, now<br />
lie vanquished in its nest, languidly eying the forest<br />
in disapproval, and dreaming of its younger years;<br />
in this state I saw that people, who must be punished.<br />
Now come, ye gods, and let us design a suitable fate<br />
for the mortals who dwell beyond roaring Atlantes;<br />
as long ago I myself had appointed destruction<br />
for the race of Lykaon, when that impertinent man,<br />
seeing the approach of a humble guest, who in truth<br />
was I myself, in disguise as a peasant, offered fine meal,<br />
but in which was admixed a most foul ingredient,<br />
the entrails of innocent children: for thus he wished<br />
to confound me, and to lead me into criminality.<br />
But I, since I am a god, and blessed with perspicacity,<br />
saw through it all, and in my anger threw over the table,<br />
and changed the form of that accursed man, so that<br />
in appearance he should resemble his blackened heart.<br />
But moreover—as venerable Poseidon, bull of the sea,<br />
no doubt recalls—I bid him to sweep away the mortals<br />
in a great flood; wherever Nereus sounds, throughout<br />
the whole world. Perhaps you, too, will recall, that<br />
of all the mortals, eaters of bread, two alone survived,<br />
Deukalion, the sailor, and his wife, circumspect Pyrrha,<br />
who, out of so many, alone were pleasing to me; thus<br />
I give proof of my rage, and punish the offending race.<br />
But now the monkey-like people of America, as you see<br />
plainly with your own eyes, have grown a thousandfold<br />
more insolent than even Lykaon’s race.» Thus he spake,<br />
and shook three times his formidable mane, and then<br />
a fourth time, leaning into his ivory scepter, and groaned.<br />
Nor, O immortal gods, did you dare to look away once;<br />
for Zeus reigns over Olympos, and makes the law<br />
for mortals and gods alike. But now spake Argeiphontes,<br />
son of the immortal Thunderer, messenger of the gods:<br />
«There is none, Father, who dwells in high Olympos<br />
and does not see the dissoluteness and debauchery<br />
of that monkey-like people. For in truth they cling to<br />
their glorious past, ever dreaming of its return, and thus<br />
are blind to the future and fearful of everything foreign.<br />
But still tell us, Father, of the fearsome punishment<br />
which you have reserved for that impudent people.<br />
Do you, perchance, aim to set ablaze their homes<br />
with your unerring lightning-bolts, burning down<br />
their houses, fields, and livelihoods? Or do you, as before,<br />
plan to smite them with flood, bidding great-maned<br />
dreadful Poseidon to let loose water and wind admixed?»<br />
Then the mighty Thunderer addressed his son thus:<br />
«What you say, my son, are not at all unpleasing to me;<br />
for the people of that race deserve all that we can devise.<br />
But in truth, as the condemned prisoner often wishes<br />
rather to die, if there is any honor left in him, than<br />
to endure bondage, so too death will come too easy,<br />
not altogether satisfactory, nor dark destruction.<br />
Moreover we immortal gods, if we wish to destroy<br />
someone, or perchance all the mortal races, or even<br />
nymphs, fauns, and satyrs, who properly are half-gods,<br />
we may accomplish it: such is the power which we wield.<br />
It matters not, then, whether a race is virtuous, or<br />
wholly given to criminal deeds, as that of Lykaon;<br />
to be destroyed thus is no punishment, but merely<br />
the doings of inscrutable Fates, who spin their threads<br />
for all. No; if ever the Americans are to be punished,<br />
it must be by their own hands; to death and disaster<br />
we shall merely lead them, and watch as they walk in,<br />
spurred by their own depravity and not by our will.»<br />
Thus he spake, and the immortal gods all nodded.<br />
For mighty Zeus spake with reason, and in any case<br />
none among them wished to incur his august wrath.<br />
Then the grey-eyed goddess Athene spake thus:<br />
«The fate of a people, I say, if we immortal gods do not<br />
interfere, owes much to its leader: what sort of man<br />
he is, or what sort of woman. Thus if we should wish ill<br />
on that monkey-like race, which they are to enter into<br />
by their own volition, and not our incontrovertible will,<br />
we need but to thrust upon them a foul and vile man<br />
as their leader, and watch as they invest in him power.»<br />
To this the mighty Thunderer nodded in approval:<br />
«Have no fear, ye gods, for we see all and hear all<br />
which underneath the snowy peaks of Mount Olympos<br />
should perchance take place in the world of the mortals.<br />
I know of a man who, if ever there is one unsuited<br />
to the rigors of leadership—and I should know it well,<br />
being leader of the most august heavenly abode myself—<br />
can claim that title effortlessly, so abominable as he is.<br />
Yet the race that dwells beyond the roaring Atlantes<br />
demonstrating its dissoluteness, has made him richer<br />
beyond all mortals, since he is by as much more decadent;<br />
for this crime alone, even if they were otherwise virtuous,<br />
that race deserves what we now purpose to inflict on them.<br />
But come, Argeiphontes Hermes, since you are my son<br />
and always I have called upon you, should a message<br />
to some god or mortal I wish to send. Go forth to America,<br />
and bear my winged words to Donald of the orange hair.<br />
Say that he is to contest for the leadership of his people,<br />
and persuade him by all means to persevere in this goal.»</p>
<p>Thus the mighty Thunderer spake, and Hermes obeyed.<br />
Presently he took the form of a winged bird and flew away,<br />
down from the snow-covered peak of high Mount Olympos<br />
across innumerable lands and seas, and roaring Atlantes<br />
‘til he landed on the gilded window-seams of Trump Tower.<br />
Just presently Donald of the orange hair was soundly asleep,<br />
blissfully unaware of the presence of the winged god.<br />
So Argeiphontes took the form of a venerable old man<br />
and entered the dream of Donald of the orange hair.<br />
Thus he approached addressed Donald with winged words:<br />
«Donald Trump, wherefore do you wander aimlessly,<br />
without energy and altogether listless? I have come<br />
to bear a message from my father, Zeus the Thunderer:<br />
he bids you to contest for the leadership of your people<br />
and promises to see to it that you defeat your rivals.<br />
For the gods are mighty, and their words are accomplished.<br />
So you will become president, and be glorious even more.»<br />
Thus he spake, but Donald of the orange hair responded:<br />
«Leave me be, old man, and stop preaching your gods.<br />
For in our world it is money which accomplishes things,<br />
which effects our will. We have then no need of gods.<br />
Besides, what use, tell me, do I have for the presidency?<br />
I am already fabulously rich, with a name known to all.<br />
Tell this god of yours that I have no need for much else.»<br />
Thus he spake, and the haughty heart of Hermes sank.<br />
So Argeiphontes accosted Donald of the orange hair again:<br />
«What sort of word escaped your teeth’s barrier, Donald?<br />
Do you then not have any respect for the gods at all?<br />
For in truth I tell you that, if not greed, then green fear<br />
should suffice to compel you to obey my father’s will.<br />
For beyond all others he hates those who deny his power,<br />
insolent men, who fancies themselves above his reach.<br />
Indeed, if you refuse him, the god will devise for you<br />
all kinds of cruel punishment, that others may fear him.»<br />
But Donald of the orange hair did not desist from his ways,<br />
but replied thus in shameful words: «a loser you are,<br />
since you worship this phony god of yours, stupid old man.<br />
I, for one, have no fear nor respect of anyone like him.»<br />
Thus he spake, and Argeiphontes, enraged by his insolence,<br />
contemplated striking the orange-haired simpleton down,<br />
as once he struck down fearsome Argos the all-seeing<br />
on his father’s command, when the giant was set by Hera<br />
to watch over the hapless nymph Io, whom Zeus desired.<br />
So, too, his sturdy heart stirred to take up the spear,<br />
and, first heating up its tip in a fire, then strike brutally at<br />
that most insolent man, through the heart, but cutting off<br />
his tongue, from which winged words of impertinence issue,<br />
and to display it as a warning to other insolent mortals.<br />
But at this Zeus the Thunderer stayed his hand, saying:<br />
«Do you dare, reckless one, to deny my will by slaying him?<br />
In truth I am not unsympathetic to you; truly that man,<br />
whom you hate so much, is insolent beyond all mortals<br />
who had lived under Helios the shining or dusky Selene,<br />
and far and above more hateful to all we immortals.<br />
Still I remind you that my will is sovereign over Olympos,<br />
over all the fields of Thessaly and beyond in the world.<br />
You will do well to see to it that my will be accomplished.»<br />
So he spake, and the haughty heart of Hermes sank.<br />
Protesting for himself, Argeiphontes thus replied:<br />
«In truth I have no wish, Father, to contradict you;<br />
but it is not possible to move this man to action<br />
by entreaties and by intimidation; for by so much<br />
he hates and disrespects and mocks our sovereignty,<br />
and I cannot bid him to do a thing, without first<br />
visiting destruction on him and all that he has,<br />
so that by action he sees that we are indeed powerful.»<br />
But the Thunderer, almighty Zeus, was wholly unmoved.<br />
He sternly struck Hermes by the cheeks, saying:<br />
«What sort of words escaped your teeth’s barrier, son?<br />
For you seem to suggest that our will is accomplished<br />
by one way alone, namely by force and by violence.<br />
In truth, perhaps I should have appointed your sister,<br />
who in the way of crafty deception far exceeds you,<br />
and who would have found some way to persuade him.»<br />
So he spake, and the haughty heart of Hermes sank.<br />
Protesting for himself, Argeiphontes thus replied:<br />
«Do not, O immortal Father, king of great Olympos,<br />
humiliate me so by turning the task over to Pallas,<br />
but allow me to go back to that insolent man again.<br />
For in truth I, too, am not unknown for shrewdness,<br />
and I will see to it that your will be accomplished.»<br />
Thus he spake, and the great Thunderer was satisfied.<br />
But presently Argeiphontes Hermes shed his disguise,<br />
since he saw that Donald of the orange hair accorded<br />
little respect to old age, but now he took on the image<br />
of long-enduring Barack Obama, Donald’s nemesis.<br />
Now he again entered the dream of the insolent man<br />
and accosted Donald of the orange hair in this way:<br />
«Donald Trump, are you still playing the fool now?<br />
Do you still make yourself the butt of jokes, idiot,<br />
by beating the dead horse over my birth certificate?<br />
In truth you know as well as anyone, that the fuss<br />
about me being born in Kenya is all trumped-up (ha!),<br />
and all your money and fame cannot save you now<br />
from being consigned to the garbage heaps of history<br />
as a harmless little buffoon of no significance at all.<br />
For in truth I tell you, fool, that I am the president<br />
of these most exalted United States of America,<br />
a position which carries reputation far ahead of me,<br />
and a good name, so that I will be taken seriously,<br />
while you will always be known as a witless clown.»<br />
So he spake, and the inward heart of Donald was enraged.<br />
Hurling a statuette at the phantom image, he spake thus:<br />
«Little Barry, are you not content to stay at the receiving end<br />
of my jokes? Do you wish to provoke the sleeping dragon?<br />
For in truth I can command respect whenever I wish,<br />
and my support will be greater, and far stronger than yours.<br />
Truly, I say, you test my patience for one last time.»<br />
But Argeiphontes to this laughed heartily—inwards,<br />
he congratulated himself over the success of his ruse,<br />
but to Donald of the orange hair he appeared still<br />
as battle-wearied Obama, whose name is anathema.<br />
Now seeing his arch-nemesis laughing in such a way,<br />
the very blood of the insolent man boiled in his veins,<br />
and he thus addressed Argeiphontes in winged words:<br />
«In truth, Barry, you laugh because you are president,<br />
and you think that you are far better than me for it.<br />
But in truth you underestimate me, for now I too<br />
will throw my name into the presidential elections,<br />
and I will command as many supporters as there are<br />
stars in high heavens, and sand in the Libyan desert.<br />
But now put this other thing away in your heart,<br />
in case you laugh at me, and say that never ever<br />
will I get the people’s support and be elected.<br />
For indeed not much earlier before you visited me,<br />
a phantom image appeared, of some obscure old man.<br />
Indeed he spake, and told me that the very gods<br />
favor my election, and will help me be elected.<br />
Now, though I am no one to submit myself to a god,<br />
still I should hope that it is an omen of good things.»<br />
Thus he spake, and Argeiphontes was happy.<br />
Swiftly he changed back into the form of a bird,<br />
flying out of the tower, out of bustling Manhattan<br />
and across innumerable lands and seas, ‘til he reached<br />
Thessaly and high Mount Olympos, abode of the gods.</p>
<p>Now when Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,<br />
and Donald of the orange hair awoke from his sleep,<br />
then he summoned his staffers, miserable men,<br />
who work ceaselessly at the billionaire’s bidding.<br />
Seeing that his men are gathered in his spacious office,<br />
which in style, though not in size, approached Olympos<br />
and the hallowed palace of mighty Zeus, the Thunderer,<br />
that insolent man spake, his secretary taking notes:<br />
«Be advised, ye who serve me in my business dealings.<br />
For long I have wished, all in jest, to campaign<br />
for the presidency, though none takes me seriously.<br />
Now the time is come, I believe. Go and summon<br />
the Media, so that I will announce my candidacy.»<br />
Thus he spake, but his finance officer objected:<br />
«Truly, Mr. Trump, what you say to us is the law.<br />
Though we are but feeble and worthless men<br />
compared to your greatness, boss, we do endeavor<br />
to accomplish all that you bid us to accomplish.<br />
But in this one matter I do not know if the course<br />
of action, which you have devised, is wise or not.<br />
For surely a prudent man, when he desires<br />
to campaign for national high office, starts<br />
by building up a record and a good network,<br />
which takes years, and cannot be done at once.»<br />
But now Donald of the orange hair rebuked him:<br />
«Insolent man, do you wish to earn my ire so?<br />
Either the heart in you stirs for dark destruction,<br />
or you are foolish, and must be taught a lesson.<br />
Truly, I tell you, for mine is the power: you are fired!»<br />
So he chased the finance officer out of his tower,<br />
before the horrified eyes of the other staffers,<br />
so that none else dares to object to him again.<br />
Seeing this, Donald of the orange hair was satisfied,<br />
and he dismissed them, still holding a grudge<br />
against battle-wearied Obama, in whose image<br />
Argeiphontes spurred him to run for the presidency.</p>
<p>But now as mighty Hera, worshipped in Samos,<br />
retreated to her chambers, her divine heart<br />
was filled with doubt, as a vessel filled to the brim<br />
with viscous ikhor, such that at the slightest<br />
disturbance it is at risk of toppling and falling.<br />
Without letting mighty Zeus, the Thunderer, know,<br />
she summoned the goddess shining Aphrodite<br />
and addressed her thus in winged words:<br />
«Kytherian Aphrodite, shining among goddesses—<br />
it is hard, you know, for me to utter this—<br />
nevertheless I beseech you for help, friend,<br />
for I fear that my husband, mighty Zeus,<br />
once again plots some escapades with his son.<br />
You know well that those two, my husband<br />
and that accursed Hermes, illegitimate issue<br />
of his, can never be up to any good together,<br />
but always they plan for him to be with some<br />
harlot or another, diminishing my authority;<br />
for though I am the rightly wed consort of his,<br />
still he strives ever to lie with other goddesses<br />
and even mortal women, who bear for him<br />
innumerable children. I speak of Maia, that<br />
nymph who bore him the very son Hermes,<br />
and Kallisto, and Io the daughter of Inakhos.<br />
Clearly all my efforts have failed me, you see,<br />
and I must enlist your help on this matter.<br />
For yours is the power over love and lust, and,<br />
powerful though he may be, almighty Zeus<br />
cannot escape your eyes in his dallying.»<br />
To this the goddess shining Aphrodite said:<br />
«I am moved, great Hera, by the honor you do me;<br />
but this thing of which you say is not easily done.<br />
For I am mindful of the fate suffered by Argos,<br />
the all-seeing giant, slain by Argeiphontes,<br />
and I by no means wish that Zeus the Thunderer<br />
should perchance harbor any ill will towards me.»<br />
But mighty Hera thus sought to assuage Aphrodite:<br />
«Fear not, great Aphrodite, who in beauty far<br />
surpasses not only the immortals, but also all<br />
nymphs, half-goddesses, and mortal woman.<br />
Indeed Zeus appeared vehement during our council,<br />
and he spake as if he truly desired dark destruction<br />
for the mortal races, as back in the days of Lykaon.<br />
In truth, I tell you that he is not as level-headed<br />
as he makes out to be. If ever a people truly<br />
enraged him, he would show no self-control,<br />
but would hurl his lightning bolts about freely,<br />
casting down to darkly Styx all his enemies.<br />
Thus I think it most suspicious that he has shown<br />
such restraint in dealing with those Americans,<br />
and if it is true that he has some ulterior motives,<br />
which he has yet to share, all that you need to do<br />
is to share them with me, and then I will deal<br />
with the matter. You yourself are in no danger.»<br />
So she spake, and the goddess was persuaded.<br />
She promised solemnly to keep watch over Zeus,<br />
and the haughty heart of Hera was satisfied.<br />
Thus she dismissed Aphrodite, shining among goddesses,<br />
and went back to her daily work, inwardly groaning.</p>
